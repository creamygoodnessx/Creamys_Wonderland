<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Press Start K;"><font color="#00ff80" size="+1">QuakeCon
2010
- Day One</font></p>
<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt; I arrived at&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.phl.org/" target="_top">Philadelphia
International Airport</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> sometime after 8AM on Thursday. Because I still didn't trust the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_top">TSA fascist pigs</a> to go anywhere near my computer&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, I once again had it shipped down to </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.dallascityhall.com/" target="_top">Dallas</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> through&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, while carrying my 17" <a href="http://www.benq.com/" target="_top">BenQ</a> monitor with me on the plane. Unlike my last&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
trip, there were no incidents at the airport this time. However, after
I boarded the plane to Dallas just before 9AM, the flight was delayed
for over an hour due to the weather, causing me to arrive at&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> around 12:30PM Dallas time instead of the scheduled 11:40PM. Once there, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Shuttle_Bus01.avi">took</a> a <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/" target="_top">Super Shuttle</a> bus to the&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
and got there around 1:15PM. My first goal was to pick up CES from the
Business Center, as I did in 2008. However, I had entered the hotel in
a place I didn't recognize, and soon realized that I was lost. So I
went to a nearby help desk to ask where the Business Center was, and
after navigating my way through the unfamiliar part of the hotel,
passing by an area which was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Hilton_Anatole_-_Renovations.avi">under construction</a>, I soon reached my destination and retrieved CES's box. The box contained not only CES, but my <a href="http://www.directron.com/radkb.html" target="_top">illuminated Modware keyboard</a>, </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-copperhead/" target="_top">Razer Copperhead mouse</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, <a href="http://www.flexiglow.com/products/xRMousePad.htm" target="_top">Flexiglow mousepad</a> that glowed green, <a href="http://www.ge.com/" target="_top">GE</a>
headphones, and most of my clothing. The box, along with my monitor,
was too heavy for me to carry all the way to Trinity Hall where the
BYOC event was being held, so I asked for a dolly. In order to ensure
the eventual return of the dolly, the person behind the desk held on to
my non driver's ID, and soon I was on my way to the BYOC room, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Boxes_On_Dolly01.avi" target="_top">pushing the dolly</a> with CES and all of its components on it.<br><br>&gt; After getting to Trinity Hall and waiting in a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Registration_Line02.avi" target="_top">long ass registration line</a>,
I had to register for the QuakeCon and give out my personal details on
one of their laptops, because the event's organizers had decided to drop
the online registration for that year. I was then given my con badge
which had a barcode on it, and then had to have a staff member register
my equipment for the event. This meant that I had to open the boxes
that contained CES and the monitor, but because I left my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Emrald_Swiss_Army_Knife.jpg">Swiss Army Knife</a>
at home to keep it away from the TSA nazis, I had to use my house keys,
which was a real pain in the ass. Fortunately, another nearby staff
member happened to be carrying a box cutter which he lent to me, and
soon I was able to get both boxes, plus CES's inner box opened. The
first staff member then put stickers with barcodes on CES, my monitor,
mouse, keyboard, and headphones, and then I wheeled CES over to yet
another staff member who scanned the four barcodes plus my con badge.<br><br>&gt; After registering, I rolled CES and its components <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Browsing.avi" target="_top">into the BYOC room</a>
and looked for a place to set up. I was looking for a table near the
aisle, so that passersby could check out my machine, and to increase my
chances of having it appear on some other attendees'&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> videos. In 2008, I had set up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Setup.avi">right across the aisle from the NOC</a>,
but that apparently wasn't enough to get on YouTube, so I was hoping to
have better luck this time around. But as I was dragging the dolly
behind me in search for a table, CES's inner box tipped over and fell
off the dolly, causing CES and some of its peripherals to tumble out of
the box and land on the floor. Horrified, I scrambled to get everything
back into the box, and some nearby attendees were nice enough to help
me. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Table_Found.avi">found a table</a>
right next to one of the aisles in row B63. However, the power strips
on that table didn't appear to have power, so I moved to the first
table in row B65. Sometime after 3:30PM, I had hooked up CES, not
knowing if it was going to run at all after the spill it took. Not
knowing what to expect, I nervously pushed CES's power button in an
attempt to turn the system on, and mercifully, it booted up <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_top">Ubuntu</a>
normally. A little bit later, the monitor's colors started acting
weird, and I was afraid that it may have been due to damage to CES from
its spill. But since there was nothing I could have done about it, I
knew that I would have to live with it until after I got back home.<br><br>&gt; Just after 6PM, I tested my Internet connection by going to YouTube and watching one of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t" target="_top">Thunderf00t</a>'s
videos. All the web pages I visited loaded very slowly, YouTube's
videos were choppy, and I wasn't getting any sound. Disappointed with
the slow connection, I decided to play some <a href="http://shinchoujin.50webs.com/mugen/english.htm" target="_top">MUGEN</a>, and while the game itself ran OK, I still wasn't getting any sound. Puzzled, I opened <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/" target="_top">Rhythmbox</a> and tried playing an mp3 of Quad Machine by <a href="http://www.sonicmayhem.com/" target="_top">Sonic Mayhem</a>,
but there was still no sound. Once again, I was worried that I had a
problem which was the result of damage caused by CES's spill. Not sure
if the problem was because of that, or from faulty headphones, I
borrowed the headphones from another attendee, and was able to hear
music just fine. This suggested that my headphones were indeed the
problem, and I knew that I would need to somehow get a new pair.<br><br>&gt; Just before 6:30PM, two people from the <a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a>
community recognized me while I was at my table. One of them said
hello, and that a lot of the members of the community had already shown
up. While checking out the QuakeCon page at home, I saw </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">that TastySpleen was hosting a <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a>
Tournament at this year's QuakeCon, and I </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">asked the Tastypleen member if that was
true. She said that it was, and that I should talk to someone
at the tournament registration table if I wanted to sign up. She then
gave me a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Quake_2_Sculpture_Card.jpg">card</a>
with a picture of the grand prize, which was a wireframe sculpture of
the Quake 2 symbol. I mentioned that I was having a problem getting my
mouse to work with Quake 2 in <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_top">Linux</a>, and she said that&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/jehar/" target="_top">Jehar</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
used Linux intensively, and that I should talk to him about it. I
walked towards the bathrooms and saw a table with a sign that read
"BYOC Competitions", so I went up and asked the people there about the
TastySpleen tourney. They suggested that I visit The QuakeCon
Tournament Center page at qcc.at.quakecon.org and look up information
about the tournament there, so I did. However, I did not see any
tournaments mentioning anything about Quake 2 or TastySpleen. Figuring
that the Tastyspleen people hadn't put the info of their tournament on
their page yet, I decided to forget about it for the time being and
move on to other matters.<br><br>&gt; While doing some further browsing, I came across a 3D shooter that looked very similar to the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIII_%28video_game%29" target="_top">XIII</a>.
The game turned out to be the creation of someone who was creating his
own 3D shooter that ran on an engine that he created himself. It was
called <a href="http://vega.skulltag.com/" target="_top">Last Bastion</a>,
and was still under heavy development, since there were still
untextured models and unfinished animations, and the game only had one
level completed so far. The programmer let me try it out myself, so I
did, and I was very pleased with its progress. At 6:30PM, I packed up
all the empty containers and loaded them onto the dolly, then wheeled
everything all the way back to the Business Center in the main
building, returning the cart and getting back my non-driver's ID. I
then immediately went to the front desk and checked into my room, and
the desk clerk gave me two keycards and told me that my room was 4160.
When I got <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Room_4160.avi">there</a>
with my empty boxes in hand, I settled down, took a shower, and then
returned to the BYOC room sometime before 8:30PM, leaving the boxes in
my room. While rechecking the tournament page, I happened to peek down
and caught a glimpse of the cord of my headphones. When I did, I saw
that the headphones had a volume dial, something that I had completely
forgotten about. After doing the obligatory <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t44EAsLwGWA" target="_top">facepalm</a>, I realized that I no longer needed to buy another set of headphones, and that was a huge burden off my shoulders.<br><br>&gt;
Just before 9PM, I saw a guy with a Tastyspleen T-shirt walk by while I
was playing MUGEN, so I asked him about the status of the Quake 2
tournament. He went by the name Square, and he said that someone called Railwolf
was in charge of the tournament, and that he would let him know about
my query. Around 9:45PM, I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a 2 liter
bottle of <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp" target="_top">Coke</a> from <a href="http://www.zinispizza.com/" target="_top">Zinis Pizzeria</a>,
and was told that my food would reach the hotel in about 30 to 45
minutes. While I was waiting for my order, I went back to the BYOC room
and checked out some console games that some attendees brought with
them, including&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.mariokart.com/wii/launch/" target="_top">Mario Kart</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> for the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii" target="_top">Wii</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/" target="_top">Super Smash Brothers</a>, and <a href="http://streetfighter4.org/" target="_top">Street Fighter 4</a>.
Half an hour after calling Zini's, I went to the lobby to wait for the
pizza guy, and he was right there when I walked in. After paying for my
order and tipping the pizza guy two dollars, I went upstairs to get
some ice, poured some Coke in my purple drinking bottle, and brought
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Zini%27s_Pizzeria_Box%28Closed%29.jpg">pizza</a>,
purple bottle, and 2 liter Coke bottle back to down CES. I then spent
the rest of the night sitting at CES, playing some more MUGEN, and some
<a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a> as well.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
