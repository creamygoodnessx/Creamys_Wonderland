2012
- Day Three</font></p>
<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt; I spent the opening hours of Saturday playing </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><span style="color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><a href="http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SuperTuxKart</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> and trying unsuccessfully to get <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a> to run in <a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_top">OpenGL</a> GLX mode. I had found a small group of </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cybersportsnet/quakecon-2012-byoc-live-stream-experience" target="_top">BYOC</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> attendees playing Quake 2, and I wanted to join in, but my inability to get the game to run on </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> nixed that possibility. Around 4:15AM, I left the BYOC room to return to </span></font><font style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="SpaceOne" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Room_574.avi" target="_top">Room 574</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> to get some sleep, woke up around 8:45AM, took a shower, and returned to CES in the BYOC room.<br>
<br>
&gt; Around 12:15PM, I went up to the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.modders-inc.com/" target="_top">Modders Inc.</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
booth in the vendor area in the Trinity Ballroom and asked about their
case mod contest. The guy in the booth said that he could enter me in
the contest if he knew the row and seat where my computer was located.
When I checked the row number of my table, I found out that it was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Row_A50.jpg">A50</a>, so I relayed that info to the Modders Inc. person. He gave me a flyer with the number 22 written on it, and so I put that <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/CES_-_Modder%27s_Inc.jpg">next to CES</a>. Sometime before 1PM, some people from Modders Inc. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Modders_Inc.avi" target="_top">checked out CES</a>.
They asked me a few questions about the machine, such as what inspired
the machine's design, and the specs of the machine, and I answered
those questions to the best of my ability. Around 1:45PM, I heard an
announcement that the case mod contest would not be taking place at 2PM
as originally scheduled, but rather at 7PM in the Chantilly Ballroom in
the main building. At 5:30PM, an announcement came over the loudspeaker
asking anyone taking part in the case mod contest to go immediately
to the main ballroom. The numbers of the finalists were called, but
unfortunately for me, 22 was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Case_Mod_Contest_-_Finalists.jpg">not one of them</a>, meaning that I failed yet again to get into the finals of a <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a> case mod contest.<br>
<br>
&gt; Later on that night, I was sitting at CES, and saw some QuakeCon
attendees doing some work on an empty table right in front of me. When
I asked what they were working on, an attendee by the name of Parker
explained that his group was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_01.avi" target="_top">putting together a machine</a>
that was assembled entirely from parts donated from other attendees
from around the BYOC. The machine had no chassis, and was consisted of
an <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/core/core-i7-processor.html" target="_top">Intel i7 processor</a>, 8GB of RAM, and two <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/article/1692/1/" target="_top">GTX570 video cards</a>.
The group's goal was to build a powerful computer from scratch, and
have Parker wear it on his back while wearing a monitor on his chest.
During our conversation, Parker's team had <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear04.jpg">finished the build</a>,
and tested the machine by turning it on. The machine started up without
any apparent problems, and there was a bad-ass looking illuminated blue
logo on the motherboard. Soon after the successful bench test, Parker's
team used various cables and duct tape to fix</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_02.avi" target="_top">power supply</a> to his left leg,</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_03.avi" target="_top">chassis</a> to his back, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_04.avi" target="_top">monitor</a> to his chest. Once the rig was secured to Parker, he and his team <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_05.avi" target="_top">tested the machine again</a>, and then exited the BYOC room to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Quakewear_2012_06.avi">hang out</a>
in the outdoor smoking area just outside the Rotunda for a while. When
they came back to the BYOC room, they returned to the table in front of
CES and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Parker_Wearing_Quakewear06.jpg">played around</a> with WordPad for a while, where funny messages were printed out on Parker's screen with giant fonts. Soon afterwards, Parker <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Parker_Removing_Quakewear.jpg">took off the rig</a>.<br>
<br>
&gt; Throughout that same day, I kept myself occupied by sitting at CES and playing more SuperTuxKart, and a little bit of </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> and <a href="http://shinchoujin.50webs.com/mugen/english.htm" target="_top">MUGEN</a>.
I also made a few more attempts to get Quake 2 running in OpenGL GLX
mode, but try as I might, I just couldn't do it. When I wasn't sitting
at CES, I was walking around the BYOC room checking out the case
mods, and exploring the Trinity Ballroom where I bought a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Doom_T-Shirt.jpg">Doom T-shirt</a>
for $18, and a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/NotePal_X3.jpg">Notepal X3 laptop cooler</a> with blue LEDs for $30. As for food, the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><span style="color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/" target="_top">Pizza Hut</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> truck had returned that day, and I got a large pepperoni pizza for $15, and a 20 ounce </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> for $2, and that was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Saturday%27s_Meal.jpg">my meal for Saturday</a>.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
