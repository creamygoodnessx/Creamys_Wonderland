<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Press Start K;"><font color="#00ff80" size="+1">QuakeCon
2003
- Day Two</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I continued to sit
at <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/Glamdring01.jpg">Glamdring</a>
through midnight,
deciding what to do as I ran <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/" target="_top">Ad-Aware</a>
out of sheer boredom. I figured that since my first day couldn't
possibly
get any worse, logic suggested that the second day had to be better, so
I chose to give my vacation a chance to somehow redeem itself. I went
into
the lobby to try to order a pizza, but all of the pizza place in the
downtown
Dallas area were either closed or didn't deliver that late at night.
Disappointed
yet again, I staggered back to the BYOC room at around 1AM and noticed
a large crowd gathered around the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/NOC_-_Left.jpg" target="_top">left
side</a> of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/The_NOC.jpg">the
NOC</a>. They were watching these two guys playing a game called <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a>,
which
was projected on the wall. The game wasn't
played with a standard gamepad, a keyboard, or a joystick. Instead, the
players danced on these large pads, each was a 3x3 grid with an left,
up,
down, and right arrow, each on it appropriate square on the grid. The
screen
was split down the middle, and each player controlled a side. Each side
had four transparent arrows on the top of the screen, left, up, down
and
right, lined up horizontally. From the bottom of the screen, flashing
arrows
would rise up at varying speeds, and meet the transparent ones at the
top
of the screen. The goal for each player was to wait until a flashing
arrow
met its transparent counterpart, then step on the appropriate arrow on
the pad. Often, the players needed to step on two arrows at once. There
was dance music in the background, and the correct dance pattern
corresponded
with the music. (The players could pick from nearly 900 songs.) The
background
wasn't simply a solid color, but rather a variety of animated
wallpapers,
designed not only to look cool, but to be a potential distracting
agent.
Stepmania was
a truly awesome spectator sport, because it was just so damn
cool
to watch two people dancing in unison to Japanese dance music, as well
as a few American dance classics, especially when the music got really
fast, and the players had trouble keeping up. Priceless, made me forget
about the crappy time I was having so far.</font>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I went back to
Glamdring, and tinkered
with
the network settings a little more, but still couldn't connect to <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>'s
network. Then, on a whim, I plugged my Ethernet cable to another port
on
the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/" target="_top">LinkSys</a>
box,
something
I tried once before; this would be the third port I would try. Right
after
I did that, seemingly miraculously, I got an Internet connection! So I
thought, OK, I've got Web access, so maybe my vacation won't ENTIRELY
suck
after all. It wasn't much of a connection, only 10Kb per second at
best,
but dammit it was a connection nevertheless. However, I still had
trouble
connecting to <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/" target="_top">Quake&nbsp;3</a>
hosts on the network, so I thought that now that I had Web access, I
could
download the latest Q3A patch, and hope that would fix the problem. I
spent
the next several hours online, attempting to download the the latest
Quake 3
patch (<a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/win32/q3pointrelease_132.exe" target="_top">v1.32</a>).
but I kept disconnecting. I then disabled my screen saver, downloaded
from
a different server, and let it sit. It was now 5AM, and I'd been
without
sleep or anything good to eat for at least 24 hours. Since I had
nothing
important to do, and there were less than 5 people playing Stepmania, I
thought
to myself, "What the hell, I'll try it out." It was an interesting
experience,
but not really of my genre of choice.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I then felt a
sudden urge to have some of
my
Twizzlers, so I headed up to my room. When I got there, I reached into
my left pocket to grab my wallet, only to discover that the bulge in my
pocket I'd been feeling for the past few hours wasn't my wallet, but
just
a really big wad of one dollar bills I got from the guy who bought my
adapter.
So I went to the front desk for help, and the lady behind the counter
told
me to go upstairs and wait for the security guard to arrive. After
about
10 minutes, the guard showed up and opened my door. I then showed him
my
ID, and everything was cool.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; When I returned to
Glamdring, the patch
download
was in the 80% range, and didn't take much longer to finish. After
installing
the patch, I tried Quake 3 again by connecting to a FFA server, and was
expecting to get the same error message I'd been getting (forgot what
it
was.) To my surprise, Glamdring started to download a 35MB file from
the
server. Just then, I noticed a crowd gathered around the large
projection
screen to the right of the noc, so once again letting Glamdring sit
for
a download, I went up to get a closer look. Someone was playing short
and
amusing movie clips, most of which I already had in my movie archives.
One clip showed a pizza delivery guy getting hit by a car, and another
was a British salmon ad where a fisherman was fighting against a bear.
There were also a few clips of sporting accidents.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; When I returned to
Glamdring again, the
35MB
was only 5% finished, just where it was when I left to watch the movie
clips, so I was like "Ah to hell with it.", and disconnected from the
server.
After giving a few more servers a try, I was eventually playing my
first
Q3A LAN game of QuakeCon 2003! At last, it felt that I was starting to
gain back some lost ground on my trip, and that it wouldn't suck so bad
after
all. I thought to myself, "OK, so maybe I didn't get to play in a
tournament
this year. But hey, I'm in the BYOC, and that's what I originally came
for, so I'm not going to complain."</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Sometime around
dawn, I noticed <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/Postal.jpg">someone
on his PC</a> just in front of the noc playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_2" target="_top">Postal
2</a>. I went to get a closer look at the game, and soon and
small
crowd
followed. It was a first person shooter about an antisocial, homicidal
madman who kills innocent people. There are a variety of weapons, most
of them unconventional, and meant to make their victims suffer before
dying,
rather than "one shot, one kill" weapons. For example, you can chase
down
people with a can of gasoline, throw a match on them, and watch them
run
around and burn. If you shock someone with a stun gun, that person will
drop to the floor, curl up in a fetal position, and then start pissing
uncontrollably. Even a stream of piss can be used as a weapon. It's
slightly
green and apparently highly toxic, because if you keep the stream on
someone
long enough, that person will vomit blood. However, if you go to far
with
the killing spree, the police and some armed civilians can fight back
and
kill you. However, the player I was watching didn't seem to take any
damage,
because it looked like he was using some kind of a cheat code. Postal 2
is a fun game to watch for a while, but I wouldn't buy it, because I
have
a feeling it has very little replay value.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I finally broke my
30+ hour "fast" just
before
9 that morning. (If you ignore the french fries I had at the airport
just
before my flight the previous day.) I went downstairs to the first
floor,
and gave the hotel's dining area a try. My breakfast was nothing
special,
just a buffet consisting of coffee, bread and butter, a small bowl of
Fruit
Loops, and some milk.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I had been awake
for 27 and a half hours
straight
when I got back to the BYOC after breakfast, but for some reason, I
just
didn't feel tired. After playing a few more rounds of Quake, I
unexpectedly
got a chance to redeem myself for missing my slot in the Quake 3
tourney.
At around 1PM, an announcement came over the loudspeaker that the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wireheadstudios.org/generations/" target="_top">Generations Arena</a></font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.wireheadstudios.org/generations/" target="_top"></a>
mod team was holding a contest, and I immediately jumped at the chance
to join. The Generations people gave all the contests installation
disks
for the mod, and I installed my copy right away. I sure as hell wasn't
going to miss my turn at this tourney too, so I asked someone at the
Generations
mod team when the contest was going to start, and he said it was going
to be around 5 or so.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Since it wasn't
even 2PM yet, I figured
that
I had enough time to get myself better prepared for the Generations
tournament.
I was going to use my no-frills keyboard, but since I had sold my PS/2
to USB adapter the previous day, that was no longer an option, so I
planned
on buying another such adapter, or a USB keyboard. So I went to the
hotel's front desk, and asked the lady behind the desk if there was a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/" target="_top">Radio
Shack</a> nearby. She said there was one in a mall one train stop
north
of the hotel. I was a bit nervous about taking the train by myself, but
I got there without too much of a hassle. (I overshot my destination by
one stop, but took the southbound train and corrected my mistake.)
Radio
Shack didn't have anything I could use, but <a href="http://www.officemax.com/" target="_top">OfficeMax</a>
did; a USB
keyboard from <a href="http://www.logitech.com/" target="_top">Logitech</a>.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I got back to the
hotel at around 4:15PM,
just
enough time to order a pizza and have a few slices. I ordered a
pepperoni
pizza and a 20oz Coke from <a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/" target="_top">Pizza
Hut</a>, and I was told my order would arrive in about 45
minutes. I
used
this time to get in some Generations practice, and to get used to my
new
keyboard. At 5:30, I went to check if the pizza guy had arrived yet,
and
went to the front desk to check if he had. The people behind the desk
said
there was someone here from the pizza place, and he had been waiting
for
me for a while. So I rushed towards the elevators to get upstairs to my
sixth floor room, when I just happened to pass the pizza guy in the
lobby,
heading out of the hotel. He said he'd been waiting by my door for the
past ten minutes before he finally gave up and decided to leave. So I
tipped
him an extra dollar to make up for the inconvenience.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I settled down in
an eating area in the
lobby
about 15 feet away from where I met the pizza guy, when I noticed a guy
on a couch about 40 feet in front and to the left of me. I could only
see
his back, but I saw what looked to be the back of a <a target="_top" href="http://polycount.com/">Polycount</a> T-shirt,
which was what I was wearing at the time. I took a closer look, and
sure
enough, it was a Polycount T-shirt. When I got closer still, I realized
that its wearer was none other than Drew
"rogue13" Risch (Polycount's admin) with a few of his friends. I talked
to him for a minute or two, and he said that although he wasn't
originally
able to make it to QuakeCon, he got a lucky break at the last minute.
After
talking to r13, I went back to where I was sitting, ate a couple slices
of pizza, and brought the rest of it to my room. There was no fridge,
so
I was forced to leave it out on a table.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I got back to
Glamdring just before 5
that evening,
and found out the rules of the first round of the Generations tourney.
There were to be four free-for-all matches, with eight players in each
match, and only the top four out of those eight would advance to the
next
round. Since I wasn't in the first match, and the second one wasn't
scheduled
for another 45 minutes, I decided to get a little shut-eye. So I
cleared
a spot on my table, put my jacket on the table in a rolled up position,
then rested my head on the jacket. After 35 continuous hours of no
sleep,
the little rest that I got then was quite a relief. I couldn't take a
picture
of myself sleeping, but if I could, I would have looked something like
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/Sleeper.jpg">this
guy</a>.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; When the second
match of the tournament
happened
around 5:45, I found that I wasn't in that match either, so I went back
to sleep, though I don't know how long I was asleep for. When I did
wake
up, I went back to the Generations table to make sure I didn't miss my
turn, which I mercifully didn't. On my way back to my table, I noticed
someone playing a remake of Doom called <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/137590/130000/fileinfo/Doom---JDoom" target="_top">JDoom</a>,
which basically looked like Doom with OpenGL features. The guy was
playing
the <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/doom/doom2/" target="_top">Doom 2</a>
level Tricks &amp; Traps, and it was hilarious watching him swear a
lot
as he kept getting killed. When my turn finally came in the fourth
match
of the first round at 10PM, I showed up on the server along with two
other
guys. Since the other five guys never showed up, the three of us won by
default. The rest of the night is kind of a blur to me, but I do
remember
playing more Quake 3 on the network, taking a picture of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2003/Glamdring02.jpg">my
new table setup</a>, and trying unsuccessfully to get <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/kazaalite/" target="_top">KaZaA
Lite</a> to work right.</font></p>
