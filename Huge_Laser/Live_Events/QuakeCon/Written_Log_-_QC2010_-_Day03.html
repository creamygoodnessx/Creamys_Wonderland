<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt; After disappearing for a while,&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">Square</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> came back with the Memory Stick in hand just after midnight, and said that the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> source code was on it. I put the stick into my <a href="http://www.connectland.com.hk/main/product/html/new_product.php" target="_top">Connectland</a> card reader, and copied a folder named <a href="http://jdolan.dyndns.org/trac/wiki/AprQ2" target="_top">APRQ2</a>
to my home folder. Square then took over, going to the copied folder in
the command line, and entering "make" to compile the code.
Unfortunately, he got an error and realized he needed to compile some
dependencies, something that would have taken a long time, so he left
the table and said he would return soon. Just before 1AM, I ran to
the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Information_Desk.jpg">Information Desk</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
to ask what the word was on the case mod contest. The staff there said
that the judges would be in the main building sometime after sunrise,
and that it would be announced over the loudspeaker in the BYOC room
when they were ready to begin the final round. Soon after that, Square
showed up again and said that his team had been sidetracked, and that
he would try to help me compile APRQ2 after sunrise, but suggested that
I try to do it myself in the meantime. Sometime after 1:30AM, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Creamy&amp;Musical_Ninjas.jpg">three people dressed as ninjas</a> showed up at my table, playing some kind of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Musical_Ninjas.avi">weird music</a>.
One of the ninjas had and electric guitar, and another had an
electronic oscillator which he used as a musical instrument. After 2AM,
I finished work on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Games/MUGEN/Characters_-_Brandy_Oteigh.html">Brandy</a>'s last Stance sprite (Stance08) for her swim trunks outfit, and left the BYOC room around 4PM to get to bed.<br><br>&gt; Sometime after ten that Saturday morning, I got out of bed, showered, changed into my&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
2008 shirt, and went back to the BYOC room. I immediately went to the
Info Desk, and again asked about the case mod contest, and the staff
said that they were meeting in the grand ballroom in the main building
at 1PM. Just before 11:30AM, I called up <a href="http://www.dominos.com/" target="_top">Dominos</a> and ordered a small pizza, some Cinnisticks, and a 2 liter bottle of&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp" target="_top">Coke</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> which were supposed to get to the <a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">hotel</a>
in about 30 minutes, and then headed back to&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">. On the way back, I
talked to someone else who had also entered his machine in the case mod
contest, and he was nice enough to call one of the judges on his cell
phone and ask him about the contest. After the call, he told me that
judges did their rounds between 8PM and 11PM the previous night, which
was when my flag went missing. Twenty minutes after I ordered my pizza,
I got a call from the hotel's front desk on my cell phone saying that
my pizza had just been delivered, so I hurried over and picked&nbsp;up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Saturday%27s_Meal%28Closed_Boxes%29.jpg">my order</a> and left a tip of over $2.50.<br><br>&gt;
An announcement came over loudspeaker at noon, saying that all BYOC
tournaments were now open and that all participants should go over to
the BYOC Competitions table and officially register by filling out a
form. As for the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
Quake 2 tournament, CES still wasn't ready to run the game, so I
reluctantly went to the qcc.at.quakecon.org website and withdrew from
the tournament. A short time later, another announcement came over the
loudspeaker, this time saying that the registration for some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter" target="_top">Street Fighter</a> tournaments were starting, so I rushed over to sign up for the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike" target="_top">Street Fighter 3:
Third Strike</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
tourney. After waiting in line, I talked to the people at the
registration desk, and they said that they were taking registrations
for&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://streetfighter4.org/" target="_top">Street Fighter 4</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> and&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/" target="_top">Super Smash Brothers</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> only, and that the registration for SF3 would be announced later.<br><br>&gt; I returned to my table, and soon after I did, PeeWee
from the TastySpleen community showed up and&nbsp;offered to help me
get Quake 2 running on CES. I ran the game and showed him my problems
with getting the mouse to work, and the problem I was having with
compiling APRQ2. The tourney was about to start, and it looked like
there was no hope of me joining, but then another member of TastySpleen
by the name of Amp offered to let me borrow his machine so I could
compete. So I hurried over to his machine and rushed back to
qcc.at.quakecon.org to re-enter the TastySpleen tourney, but as I was
doing so, it was announced at 1PM over the loudspeaker that the finals
of the case mod contest was starting in the main ballroom, so I rushed
over there as fast as I could. When I got there, a staff member said
that if I wasn't told that I made it into the final round, then I
didn't make it. Knowing the case mod contest was over for me, I hurried
back to the TastySpleen tables to rejoin their tournament. I was teamed
up with vi0cs, and we played two rounds against Quest and Gator,
and we got our asses handed to us both times, which eliminated me from
the tournament. I had been recording my two rounds as I played, and
after the rounds were over, I copied the recorded games onto my
Connectland USB hub / card reader, and went back to CES around 3PM. As
a final note on the TastySpleen tourney, Quest from the community came
by at around 4:15PM and gave me a TastySpleen T-shirt just for
competing.<br><br>&gt; I spent the next several hours playing&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Hero" target="_top">DJ Hero</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> alongside another attendee on his machine, trying unsuccessfully to get <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/totem/" target="_top">Totem</a> to play my <a href="http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/" target="_top">Simpsons Movie</a> DVD, and playing&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://shinchoujin.50webs.com/mugen/english.htm" target="_top">MUGEN</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> amongst other things. I also kept checking the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Console_Tournament.jpg">console&nbsp;section</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
of the BYOC room to see if the registration for Street Fighter 3 was
taking place, and each time, I was told that it hadn't yet. However,
when I checked back at 10:30PM, it turned out that I had missed out on
the registration. Fortunately, one of the staff members was kind enough
to give me his slot, and I spent the rest of the night waiting
patiently in the console section for my turn.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
