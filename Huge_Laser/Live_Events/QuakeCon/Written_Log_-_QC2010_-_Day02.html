I was still on&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> after midnight, playing&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://shinchoujin.50webs.com/mugen/english.htm" target="_top">MUGEN</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> and then drawing a
sprite (Stance07) for the swim trunks outfit of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Games/MUGEN/Characters_-_Brandy_Oteigh.html">Brandy Oteigh</a> MUGEN
character. While I was working on the sprite, a small group of&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
attendees, one of which was carrying a large video camera, asked me what I
was working on. I explained what MUGEN was, and that I had been working
on Brandy for the past two years, and even showed them the current
version of Brandy (<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/MUGEN/Characters/Brandy_Oteigh/CGX_Brandy%28P%29/CGX_Brandy%28P%29%28v1.2%29.zip">1.2</a>) in action in MUGEN's Watch Mode. Sometime after
2:30AM, another attendee came by and complimented me on CES, and asked
me some questions about it. At this point, he had been only one of many
to do so, but what made him stand out was the fact that he suggested
that I enter an upcoming case mod contest, and said that I should go to
the Information Desk to ask about it. He said that CES could have a
good chance of doing well in the competition, and I happened to agree,
so I took his advice and went to the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Information_Desk.jpg">Information Desk</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> to sign up. The
staff there gave me a short form to fill out, and once I did that, they
gave me a yellow flag which read "The Home Depot" to put on my machine.
With the flag in hand, I went back to CES and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/CES_-_Flag.jpg">stuck the flag</a> in the
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Cn%29_-_Coating04.jpg">Coins angle iron</a>. For the next few hours, I looked around the BYOC
room, checking out the case mods and some console games that people
brought with them, including&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;"><a href="http://www.rockband.com/" target="_top">Rock Band</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, and&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsunoko_vs._Capcom:_Ultimate_All-Stars" target="_top">Tatsunoko VS Capcom</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, and
then left the BYOC room to go back to my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Room_4160.avi">hotel room</a> for some sleep
around 5AM.<br><br>&gt; At eleven in the morning, I got out of bed,
changed my clothes, filled my purple drinking cup with ice, and went
back to CES in the BYOC room where I checked back on the QuakeCon
Tournament Center page (qcc.at.quakecon.org) to see if the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
people had posted their tournament yet. I found that they now had one
listed, which was called the QuakeCon 2010 - The Tasty Spleen Experience, which
was a </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> 2 vs 2 tournament, so I registered for it by starting my
own team called The Creamy Experience. There were other new tournaments
on that page as well, and I decided to sign up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike" target="_top">Street Fighter 3:
Third Strike</a> tourney as well, and I was the first person to sign up for
that tournament. Given the fact that I'd never played Street Fighter 3
before, I wanted to get in some practice before the playing in the
tournament, so I went over to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Console_Section02.jpg">console gaming section</a> of the BYOC
room. While I was waiting for a staff member there to set up the game,
I learned that the tournament was scheduled to start the next day at
5PM.<br><br>&gt; I played some more MUGEN and&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> for a while,
and then got to work on trying to get Quake 2 to run on CES. After
solving a "file not found" type of error by creating a file named
quake2.conf in CES's /etc folder, I began to update my repositories in
the hopes that one of them might have libvga, which I needed to run the
game, and let the update run while I checked out the vendor area in the
other room. Some QuakeCon attendees were crowded around a stage right
next to the room's entrance, and the people on the stage threw candy
and mousepads for the attendees to catch. I watched the giveaway for a
few minutes, and then looked around the room some more and came across
a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Mad_Katz_Booth.jpg">table</a> where a company called <a href="http://www.madcatz.com/" target="_top">Mad Katz</a> was selling a variety of gaming
hardware. One item that caught my attention was a high end illuminated
keyboard that glowed in multiple colors at the same time. It was called
the <a href="http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/v7keyboard.htm" target="_top">Cyborg Keyboard</a>, and normally sold for a hundred dollars, but was
now on sale for only $60. Not willing to pass up such a good deal, and
driven by my fascination for LEDs, I bought one of the keyboards and
headed back towards CES.<br><br>&gt; On the way to my table, I saw that
someone had brought <a href="http://www.thebeatlesrockband.com/" target="_top">Beatles Rock Band</a> to the QuakeCon, and was playing the
guitar. He invited me to join him in a game, so I rushed to get <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Elite_Keyboard.jpg">my new&nbsp;keyboard</a> to my table, then came back and played vocals for my first
time ever. The song that popped my Rock Band vocals cherry was Ticket
To Ride, and then we played Come Together. I then switched to bass when
a third player joined in, who took over for the vocals. As I was
playing, I heard an announcement that the starting times of BYOC
tournaments were being shown at the BYOC Competitions table, so I
played one more song, quit, then went to the table to ask about
TastySpleen's tournament. The people there checked their schedule and
said that the TastySpleen people were going to meet at that very table
at 6PM. They said that they would announce TastySpleen's arrival to the
table over the loudspeaker, so I went back the CES to continue trying
to get Quake 2 to run while waiting for that to happen. It was already
about 4:30PM, and this didn't give me a lot of time to work.<br><br>&gt;
I went to the BYOC Competitions table at 6PM and waited for the
TastySpleen people for about 10 minutes, but I didn't see them show up,
so I returned to CES to continue my attempt to get Quake 2 running. I
managed to fix an "svgalib: Cannot get I/O permissions." error by
setting the owner of the Quake 2 executable file as "root", and the
game started up. However, the mouse would not work in Software Mode,
and Software X11 Mode messed up the colors and distorted the image. I
spent over an hour trying to get the mouse to work in software mode,
but to no avail. Plus, I didn't hear anything about TastySpleen on the
loudspeaker, so I went to the BYOC Competitions table to find that the
TastySpleen people had still not shown up. So at that point I
considered giving up on the tournament, and got in some more practice
for Street Fighter 3. I went back to the BYOC Competitions table around
9:30PM and asked about the TastySpleen Quake2 tournament. The staff
there said that the tournament had moved to midnight, so I decided to
give fixing Quake on CES another try. As I was headed back, a member of
the TastySpleen community on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Noc.jpg">the NOC</a> recognized me and called out to
say hello. He said that the was going to meet the rest of the team, who
just happened to be hanging out near my table. So I went over to talk
to them, and explained that I wanted to join them in the tournament,
but the mouse problem could potentially force me to withdraw. The team
was on their way to see a movie, but they offered to help me with my
problem after they got back.<br><br>&gt; A little later on in the
night, I played some Rock Band which was being <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Rock_Band01.avi">projected on a nearby
wall</a>. When I got back to my table around 11PM, I noticed that the case
mod contest flag was missing from CES. I wasn't sure if the judges had
been by my table yet, or if somebody had stolen the flag, so I went to
the Information Desk for help, and the people there said that the
judges were currently going by, but they didn't know what the missing
flag meant. When I asked another contestant if the judges had talked to
him, and explained my situation to him, he was nice enough to give me
his flag which he wasn't using anymore. I hurried back to CES with the
flag in hand, and put it on the machine where the old one used to be. A
little after 11:30PM,&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">Square</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> came by my table and offered to help me
with my Quake 2 problem. He said he could help me install another build
of the game, and that he could use a Flash drive to transfer the
necessary files from his laptop to CES, so I gave him my 1GB Memory
Stick.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
