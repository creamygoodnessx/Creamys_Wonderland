2006
- Day Four</font></p>
<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt;
Around 1AM
on the final day
of the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>,
I was heading out of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2006/BYOC01.jpg">ballroom</a>
to get a few hours of sleep, but just as I was about to reach the door,
I saw a <a href="http://www.redoctane.com/" target="_top">Red
Octane</a>
metal dance pad on the floor in front of the information desk, and knew
right away that someone was setting up <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a>.
I
decided that sleep would have to wait a while, since I was looking
forward to playing the game at the 'Con for months. As the game was
being installed, I gave the guy who was setting up the game my CD of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Games/Stepmania/Song_Packs_-_CreamyMix01.html">CreamyMix
1</a>, which is my unfinished mix of 11 songs that I had made
steps
for. This was now added to the other mixes on the machine, including
most of the DDR official mixes, as well as two anime theme mixes.
Nearly a dozen people including myself took turns <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2006/Stepmania.avi">playing</a>
one song per turn,
with the game set to seven songs per game, the fail off, and no time
limit on the song selection wheel. The songs I played including
included Little Bitch from the official mixes, Havana Club from Bantu
Originals, as well as Invader Zim and Breaking the Law from CreamyMix
1. A few hours into the game, play had to be suspended temporarily
because a corner of one of the squares was sticking up, but after about
half an hour, the problem was fixed and play resumed. At around 6AM, I
finally left the ballroom to get what little sleep I still could.<br>
<br>
&gt; I woke up around 8:30PM, and after another shower, I gathered
all
of my possesions from <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2006/Room_7187.jpg">my
hotel room</a> except for my dirty laundry, and went to the
ballroom to
dismantle <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a>. When I got there, the room had <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2006/Teardown.jpg">significantly
fewer people</a> than it did only a few hours ago, and there were
a few
large machines scattered about, including forklifts. Once I had CES and
all of its paripherals were back in their boxes and checked by
security, I wheeled everything back to the front desk in the main
building on a wooden dolly I found lying around. I then went back to my
room, stuffed my laundry into a plastic garbage bag I got from a
cleaning cart in the ballroom, left my room for the last time, and
checked out of the
<a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a> just after noon.
Following
my mother's
advice, I went to the hotel's buisness center to send the ice maker box
and the monitor home via <a href="http://www.fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a>,
so I wouldn't have to lug that weight to the airport and risk losing
CES again. I then crammed my laundry bag into my backpack, completely
freeing my hands of anything to carry. With nothing left to do at the
hotel, I went outside and waited about half an hour for a shuttle bus
ride to <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas
Fort Worth</a>.
On the bus, I met another QuakeCon
attendee named <a href="http://www.jitspoe.com/" target="_top">Jitspoe</a> who told me about a few
project he had been
working on, including a <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake
2</a>
paintball mod called <a href="http://digitalpaint.org/" target="_top">Digital Paint</a>. After getting to Fort
Worth, I took
the 3:30PM flight back to Phillidelphia.<br>
<br>
&gt; Despite not initially having CES with me at the QuakeCon, and
not
being able to play any games over the network, I still had a really
good time at the event. I took over and hundred <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Photo_Log_-_QC2006.html">pictures</a>
and shot about 25 <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies_-_QC2006.html">movies</a>
of the 'Con on my </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="SpaceOne" size="-2"><a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">Sony Cybershot</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">, and blew
through three
pairs of AA
batteries and two memory sticks in the process. I also took home two
T-shirts, a UV sensitive nVidia plastic cup, and a mousepads as
souveniers. During the event, someone would occasionally come by and
ask about CES and complement me on it, and those were amongst if not
the best of my experience at the event. If I get lucky, I'll be able to
go back in two years to the QuakeCon of 2008 with an upgraded CES, as
well as a few people to share the experience with.</span></font><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span>
