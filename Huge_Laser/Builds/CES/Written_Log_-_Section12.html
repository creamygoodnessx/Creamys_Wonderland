<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">8/6/2004
- I spent
today
shopping online for components that would make the initial build of CES
more powerful. Around 2:30 this morning, a <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>
search led me to the&nbsp;</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.ituner.com/" target="_top">ituner</a></font><font size="-2">
online catalog, where I found a </font><font size="-2">Via Epia P4 ITX
Motherboard</font><font size="-2"> for only $185.00. This was a
motherboard I
was planning to upgrade to after the initial completion of CES for the
2005 <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>.
However, because I had found it at only $185, as opposed to over $200
on <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/" target="_top">Mini-ITX.com</a>
and on other sites, I was beginning to think that I could use it
instead
of the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">VIA
EPIA V10000A</a></font><font size="-2">. About two or three weeks ago, when case modder
<a href="http://www.slipperyskip.com/" target="_top">Jeffrey
Stephenson</a> responded to an e-mail question of mine, he
pointed out
a few weakness of the V10000A, and this influenced me to look for
alternatives.
The P4 came to mind, but until now, it was too expensive for my $800
budget.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The last time
I checked
CES's budget, the total cost between items already purchased and items
on my shopping list came out to be $696.95, giving me just over a
hundred
dollars to spare. If I am to go with the P4 instead of the V10000A, I
will
have to buy a processor separately, since the P4 does not have one
soldered
onto it. I'll also need a stick of PC2100 DDR RAM, as opposed to the
PC133
SDRAM that the V10000A supports. Therefore, both the VIA EPIA
V10000A
motherboard, and the two sticks of SDRAM can come off my budget. The
motherboard
and RAM cost a total of $259.97, and adding the $103.05 left on my
budget
will give me a total of $363.02 to spend on the P4 motherboard, the DDR
RAM, and the processor.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Getting the
$185 P4
motherboard leaves me with $178.02 to spend on the RAM and processor.
These
two components are often the most expensive in a computer system, so I
knew I'd have to do some serious shopping around to stay within my $800
spending cap. I knew that <a href="http://www.directron.com/index.html" target="_top">Directron</a>
sold RAM, and since I was already planning to buy a bunch of items from
them, I checked to see if they had any <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/ddr266.html" target="_top">PC2100
DDR RAM modules</a>. I found a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Kingston_512MB_PC2100_184-pin_Memory_Module.jpg">512MB
stick</a> of this kind of RAM for $112, which seemed a little
high, but
since I was buying other items on Directron, I would only have to pay
shipping
and handling costs once for all the items. Eventually, after more
shopping
around, I came across a site called Xtreme Computer Systems, which sold
various types of RAM. I found a 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM module for $85.75;
over $25 cheaper than the same one at Directron.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The P4
motherboard
supports <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm" target="_top">Pentium</a>
and <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/celeron/" target="_top">Celeron</a>
processors, and because of my tight budget, Celeron was the only way to
go. Luckily, Xtreme sold processors as well as RAM, and I found two
2.4Ghz
478-pin processors; one for $80.99, and the other for $76.99. I'm
planning
on buying the $76.99 chip, but I'm keeping the other one bookmarked
just
in case the cheaper one either becomes unavailable or has a price
increase.
Because I'm buying both RAM and a processor from the same site, I'm
only
going to have to pay one S&amp;H charge for both items.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
As far as how
all
of today's shopping around will affect my budget, here's the breakdown.
Starting with a total cost of $696.95, I'm replacing my $87.99 Via Epia
V10000A motherboard with a $185 Via Epia P4 ITX. This increases my
budget
by $97.01.</font> </p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$696.95
total
budget
+ $97.01 more spent = $793.96 total budget</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The P4 does
not come
with a processor of its own, and that's where the $76.99 Intel Celeron
2.4Ghz 478-pin processor comes in.</font> </p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
This pushes
me way
over my $800 cap, but fortunately, the RAM comes to the rescue. There
is
only one DIMM slot on the P4, so this means I'm only getting one stick
of RAM. The 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM module I'm getting costs $85.75,
$86.23
less than the total RAM with the V10000A.</font> </p>

This puts me
very
close to my project's spending limit, with only a $15+ dollar cushion
for
shipping and handling. I've already calculated this charge for the
Directron
items, and it looks like I'm going to need two more such charges; one for Xtreme
Computer
Systems, and the other for&nbsp;</font><font size="-2">ituner</font><font size="-2">.
Assuming the charges for each site
is
less than $7.50, and assuming none of the items in the budget go up in
price, I should finish this project just below the budget's limit. If I
have any problems with the budget, I can always take the $9.99 40mm
3-LED
fan out of the picture to save money. Speaking of which, I don't know
what
kind of fan the Celeron chip will come with, if it comes with one at
all.
If it does come with a fan, it sure as hell won't have LEDs. But I can
always get an LED fan of the appropriate size from Directron for less
than
ten bucks.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Going through
with
this upgrade will come at a cost other than the extra cash that needs
to
be spent. With $15.28 left on the budget, I no longer have the cash to
upgrade my Samsung Slimline CDRW/DVD drive to a DVD burner. However, I
think the sacrifice is well worth it, since the motherboard upgrade
will
more than double CES's processing power. It will also have a TV-out
connector,
which will allow me to hook up CES to a TV and give it a true gaming
console
feel. Just before the 2005 QuakeCon, I will spend an additional $400 on
upgrades, and I can use that opportunity to buy a DVD burner, a more
powerful
Celeron processor, a 1GB stick of RAM, or some combination of the three.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7-29-2004&gt;
This
afternoon,
I began the restoration process of the flames on CES's left panel. I
began
by restoring the black background, and in the process, my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Black%29.jpg">black
Sharpie</a> died on me, so I had to grab a new one from upsairs.
Once
the
background was a solid black, I moved on to the dark green areas. I
fixed
the outline of the right fireball, and as was doing the same for the
left
fireball, I noticed that a pixel that should have been dark green on
the
right fireball was light green. It had been like this ever since I
first
painted on the flames back in January, but I never noticed until today.
After I fixed the parimeter of the left fireball, I re-colored the
errant
pixel to its proper color. After the dark green was restored, I fixed
few
faded pixels of the light green areas. I then went on to fix up the
background
of the letters a little bit with my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green</a>
Microns. I am now letting <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Left_Panel04.jpg">the
panel</a> dry, which should only take another half hour or so.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The left
panel has
dried, and so I wrapped it up and put it back in the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Puma_Shoebox.jpg">Puma
shoebox</a>, along with the right panel and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons03.jpg">four
completed 4" angle irons</a>. The paintjobs of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels04.jpg">both
side panels</a> and all four 4" beams may be completed, but I'm
not
celebrating
just yet. It's not over until I can find the ideal coating that will
protect
the paintjobs from any threats that they could reasonabley face, such
as
a sharp object bushing against the side, or a spilled drink. The
coating
will also have to be clear, not ruin the image on application, and
never
yellow with age. Only after the coating is on will the paintjob phase
of
the CES project that I've been working on for the past two months
finally
come to a close. Next month's task will be bolting the chassis
together,
and if I ruin the panels or beams that I've worked so hard on in the
process,
then my several sleepless nights of working on them will become
meaningless.</font> </p>

- It's
5PM,
and I'm almost finished applying the white to my side panels, which I
started
working on around nine this morning. I used the same <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> method I used on the white pixels of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons03.jpg">angle
irons</a>. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Flame_Whites01.jpg">covered
the white flame centers</a> of the left panel with Scotch tape,
scored
the parimeter of the white pixels with my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Flame_Whites02.jpg">peeled
off the tape</a> over the white pixels with the X-Acto knife and
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Tweezers.jpg">round-tipped
tweezers</a>. Then, I followed the same process with the right
panel,
and
then applied the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
to the white pixels of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SP_-_Flame_Whites02.jpg">both
panels</a>. I peeled off the remaining tape on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel05.jpg">right
panel</a> without a problem, but when I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Flame_Whites03.jpg">did
the same</a> with the left panel, some of the Wite-Out came off
with
it,
resulting in holes in the white pixels. I'll have to fix it, but I'm
currently
babysitting my nephews, so it will have to wait until later.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
This evening,
I began
to fix the left panel's white flame pixels. There were three tiny
primary
areas with missing Wite-Out, and I fixed them one at a time. I had to
use
tape on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Flame_Whites04.jpg">two
of the areas</a>, but I managed to fix the holes without too much
of a
problem. After this, I didn't have to use the Scotch tape anymore, and
every time I had removed a piece of tape from <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Side_Panels03.jpg">the
panels</a>, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SP_ErS_Tape_Mess.jpg">placed
it at the edge of the baby high chair</a> immediately to my
right. I
made one
hell of a mess doing so, so I'll have to clean that up before
I go
to bed.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I also had a
chance
to apply a second coat of Sharpie ink on the flames of the right panel.
Months of handling and the protective tape for the filling of the white
pixels resulted in the flames being partially scratched off and faded,
and so I felt restoring the flames by redrawing the pixels was a good
idea.
I fixed first the black pixels, and then the dark green, each color
taking
me about an hour to restore. I basically drew the outlines of a small
section
first, filled in the appropriate pixels, and then moved on to another
area.
I did restore some of the light green as well, but that color wasn't as
scratched or faded, so I only had to draw over some of the areas. I
waited
an hour or two for the ink to dry, which was more than it needed, and
then
wrapped the panel in its plastic wrap and paper towel. Tomorrow, I will
work on the other panel, and if I don't find a better protective
coating
than the nail polish, I may start applying the protective coating
tomorrow
as well.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/27/2004
- I drew
a
test pattern on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern06.jpg">second
top hatch scrap aluminum sheet</a>. It was just a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Lines_Without_Polish.jpg">simple
pattern</a> of horizontal black, green, and yellow stripes;
nothing too
fancy. I then put a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Lines_With_Polish.jpg">coat</a>
of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail
polish</a> over the pattern, but I put it on before the pattern
fully
dried, resulting in a little bit of smudging. I waited about a half
hour
before putting on a second coat, and then let that dry for nearly an
hour.
I then tried to scrape the pattern off with my fingernail, and it did
indeed
scrape off, but it took a little more force than it did with the
acrylic.
Although this seems like a failure, I'm willing to give the polish
another
chance. I drew an even simpler pattern on the panel; a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Smiley_Without_Polish.jpg">smiley
face</a>. But this time, I'm going to wait until it fully dries
before
applying the first coat of polish.</font> </p>

<a href="http://www.slipperyskip.com/" target="_top">Jeffrey
Stephenson</a> got back to me this morning, and he confirmed that
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">VIA
V10000A motherboard</a> does in fact use a 40mm fan. However, he
did
address
some concerns about the motherboard that got me a little worried. He
said
that the V10000A only supported 8MB of video RAM and that it does not
support
USB 2.0, only USB 1.0, but these are issues that I can live with.
However,
he said that the motherboard does not have a video out connector, and
this
got me a little worried. I checked Via's official site, and it did say
that there is one S-Video port on the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a></font><font size="-2">,
but I'm not sure if
this
is in or out. My plan is still to buy the V10000A, although I am
shopping
around a little more now for alternatives, mainly the Insight
P4 ITX Motherboard.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I came back
down to
the kitchen sometime after 8:30AM, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2922.jpg">Koopa
Troopa angle iron</a> was FINALLY dry. However, there where tiny
specks
of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
on some of the green areas. I used a toothpick to scrape them off, and
fortunately, I didn't scrape off to much green in the process, so I
don't
have to fix it by putting more ink on it. I put one more coat of yellow
on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2923.jpg">Fire
Flower beam</a>, but that should dry soon. Just to be safe, I'm
going to
wait another half hour before taking both beams off the table.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It seems that
I was
once again mistaken about the Koopa Troopa beam being dry. It's just
after
ten in the morning, and incredibly, the beam is still slightly damp.
However,
I think it's dry enough to take of the table, but I'm going to wait a
while
longer before wrapping it with anything. I think another six hours
should
do the trick.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Throughout
the morning,
I applied <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Smiley_With_Polish.jpg">two
coats of nail polish</a> to the test smiley on my test panel, and
allowed
them to dry. But this time around, I made sure that the first coat was
fully dry before applying the second. Just now, I tested the polish to
see how well two layers could stand up to scratching off. I used my
fingernail
to scratch at some of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Chartpak_Acrylic.jpg">Chartpak
acrylic</a> that was still on the panel. It scraped off very
easily,
and
so I tried doing the same to the nail polish. It took a lot more force
to remove the polish, and it seemed to stick a lot better to the
surface.
However, I'm still not ready to use nail polish on my beams and
angles.
I'm still going to consider other alternative coatings, but if I had to
choose between using acrylic or nail polish for protection, I would
definately
choose the polish.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Just now, I
tried
an experiment to see how a coat of nail polish over a coat of acrylic
would protect my gridded test pattern. I put some polish over the left
side of the pattern, but used a little too much polish. When I wiped
the
brush over the pattern, the pattern became badly distorted, even under
the acrylic coat. So using this acrylic / nail polish combination is
clearly
not a good choice for my work.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I started to
apply
the yellow ink to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2911.jpg">Coins</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2935.jpg">Mario</a>
angle irons this morning. I began with the Coins beam, taping it to the
table's edge on the left side of my chair. After drawing the outlines
of
the yellow areas of the two coins, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2915.jpg">filled
them in</a> to completely finish all the colors of the Coins
angle
iron.
I then taped the Mario beam right next to the Coins, just right of it.
I then used the yellow Pigma Micron to fill in the front of Mario's
hat, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2936.jpg">draw
the outline of the face</a>, fill the single pixel buttons, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2937.jpg">draw
the outline of the hands</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2938.jpg">fill
in the face</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2939.jpg">fill
in the hands</a>. This completed all of the colors of the Mario
angle
iron.
After all the colors were applied to Mario and Coins, I then began
applying
a second coat to the beams. I started with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green
Micron</a>, restoring first the green of the Coins block, and
then the
greens of the Mario block. I'm going to let the beams dry a bit before
moving on the next color.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I restored
the black
background of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2916.jpg">Coins</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2940.jpg">Mario</a>
beams, but I didn't fill in every square. I found that only redrawing
the
lightest areas and where the pencil showed through was sufficient, and
used up a lot less ink. This will hopefully be the last time I make any
major use of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a> for the rest of the project. After taking a break and
letting
the beams sit for a while, I came back and restored the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2941.jpg">brown
areas</a> of the Mario beam, which were the eyes, hair, mustache,
shirt,
and boots. Finally, I finished the restoration of the Mario beam by
re-inking
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2942.jpg">red
areas</a>, which were the hat and overalls. Because I haven't
inked the
Coins beam in a while, I can remove it from the table while the Mario
beam
can stay to finish drying.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Just after
5:30PM,
I tested my Mario angle iron to see if it was dry yet. Some of the red
was still a little wet, but I still felt that it was dry enough to
remove
from the table's edge. I then cleaned up the table, and the baby high
chair
I was using for extra temporary storage space. I took my stuff back
upstairs,
and carried the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons03.jpg">four
angle irons</a> with great care, so the inked surfaces didn't
touch
anything.
I will let them rest on my desk overnight unwrapped to give them at
least
twelve more hours to dry, just to make absolutely sure the ink doesn't smudge when I wrap them. I think I'll
take
the rest of the day off, and work on getting the Wite-Out on the side
panel
flames tomorrow.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/26/2004
- Last
night,
I applied the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
to the white areas of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2922.jpg">Koopa
Troopa angle iron</a>. I was going to go to bed right after that,
and
fix
the faded colors when I was fully rested, but I decided to take a
chance
with restoring one color first. This way, the ink of that color could
dry
as I slept, and I could then start on the next color as soon as I got
back
to the kitchen. Even though I was falling asleep, I still managed to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2923.jpg">restore
the green areas</a> of the beam without any problems.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's after
five in
the morning, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2925.jpg">I
filled in the black spaces</a> around the Koopa Troopa. This
result is
a slightly higher contrast between the turtle and the background. Some
of the smaller areas were tricky, because they had another color
directly
on either side of them. I suppose I could have redone the black areas
of
the bricks as well, but I didn't want to push my luck. I'm going to
grab
myself another slice of pizza while the black ink dries.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It appears
that I
had the nerve to fill in the black parts of the bricks after all. I
still
didn't have the balls to restore every nook and cranny of the black
areas,
so I only focused on the most faded spots. I also drew over the big
black
space at the bottom of the anlge iron, because the penciled grid was
showing
through. After I'm sure that the new black ink has dried, I will then
start
restoring the orange areas.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after eight
in the morning, and I decided to start working on the orange. Soon
after
I started, I began to notice that some of the green ink wasn't dry yet,
and started bleeding into the orange squares. So I'm going to wait a
few
more hours before trying to further fix the bleeding green. When I get
back, I plan to scrape off this errant green, and try filling in the
orange
again.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Just before
10PM,
I finished fixing the errant green ink that leaked over to the orange
squares
of the Koopa Troopa angle iron. It was simply a matter of scraping off
the green that invaded the orange squares with a toothpick, and then
drawing
over the erasure with orange. Fortunately, the green ink was now dry
enough
to work without causing any further bleeding. In addition to fixing the
orange, I also restored the green areas of the brick block. Once all of that
dries and I put the angle iron away, it will be the first beam to be
completely
finished, sans the protective coating. I'll be sure to put it in a safe
place so that nothing bad happens to it until I can get the coating on.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I was going
to wait
until the Koopa Troopa beam fully dried before removing it and taping
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">Fire
Flower beam</a> in its place, but instead chose to tape the FF
beam
next
to the KT beam. My plan was to use the same <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> strategy to get the white outer rim of the flower painted on the
Fire
Flower angle iron, using Wite-Out as my ink. Once the beam was securely
taped to the table, I covered the oval part of the flower with a
single,
horizontal <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2918.jpg">piece
of tape</a>. I scored both the outer and inner edges of the tape
over
the
white area, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2919.jpg">removed
the white section of tape</a>. I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2920.jpg">filled
in the exposed oval</a> with the Wite-Out, and the paintjob
turned out
OK, except for a slight leak on the right edge, and a little bit of
bumpiness
on the bottom edge. Once the Wite-Out was in place, I waited for it to
dry a little, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2921.jpg">removed
the rest of the tape</a>; first the part outside of the white
area, and
then the tape covering the middle and inner parts
of the flower. Finally, I restored the orange part of the flower with a
new coat of Micron ink. I'm going to leave both angle irons on the
table
while I run out to the mall to get my hair cut.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Some guys
arrived
at our house to change our basement freezer, buying me some time to
purge
the <a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">camera</a>'s
pictures for the sixth time this month. I also took some time to fix
the
pixel on the far right edge of my Fire Flower angle iron, onto which
the
Wite-Out got under the tape and leaked. It was a simple matter of
scratching
out the pixel with a toothpick, and then drawing the black over it. In
fact, I had time to put a second coat of black over all of the beam's
black
areas.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I got back
from <a href="http://www.paramuspark.com/html/Index2.asp" target="_top">Paramus
Park mall</a> a little after four this afternoon, but stopped at <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a> on the way home. While there, I found that some yellow
Pigma
Micron 05 markers were in stock, so I bought <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM05%28Yellow%29.jpg">one</a>
for only $2.05, thanks to my old <a href="http://www.bergen.edu/pages1/pages/bergenhomenew.aspx" target="_top">Bergen
Community College</a> student ID card. I also talked to some of
the
people
there about a better alternative to the acrylic I've been using, but
the
advice they gave me troubled me. It seems that the best thing that I
can
use to protect my side panels and angle irons is some kind of coating
that
is meant to protect the metal on cars. It consists of certain chemicals
that you have to mix yourself, and you have to know which ones to put
into
the formula. Not only that, but the chemicals are very expensive, the
Pearl
guys said the stuff would cost about $50 to $60 a quart! So right now,
I'm at a loss as to what kind of protection to give my hard work.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I did a bit
more work
on the Fire Flower angle iron. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2923.jpg">filled
in the yellow part</a> of the beam, which was the middle section
of the
flower's oval, between the outer white and the inner orange.
Fortunately,
I did not have any problems with it. I then restored all the green on
the
beam; first the flower's stem, and then the used "?" block. I then used
a toothpick to test the green on the Koopa Troopa block to see if it
had
dried. To my surprise, it was still wet, even after TEN FUCKING HOURS
of
sitting! I suppose I'm just going to have to wait even longer before
taking
the Fire Flower and Koopa Troopa off the edge of the table. After that,
I will have enough elbow room to put the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2911.jpg">Coins</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2935.jpg">Mario</a>
beams on the table's edge on the other side of the chair. In the
meantime,
I think a short break would do me some good.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's after
11PM now,
and the green ink on the Koopa Troopa beam is STILL not dry. I tested
this
by wadding up a small section of the green plastic protective wrap for
the beams, and touching it gently to the turtle's shell. I then touched
the wad to my thumb. A trace amount of ink ended up on my thumb, so I
knew
the ink was still wet. But the dark areas are disappearing, so I guess
that this ink is almost dry.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I was talking
to my
mother about alternatives to the acrylic coating I've been trying on my
test panels. She suggested some kind of enamal, when she all of a
sudden
thought of nail polish. Nail polish should be relitively inexpensive,
and provides excellent protection for fingernails. It does not rub or
scratch
off easily, and some of it is clear. However, I don't know if it will
yellow
in the long run. I scratched a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern06.jpg">large
section</a> of the acrylic off my second test panel with my
fingernail,
including a section with some horizontal lines. I will draw a small
pattern
on the lines, and then test some nail polish on that pattern.</font>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/25/2004
- This
morning,
I was trying to get a better idea of how the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">slimline
drive mounting rack</a> would fit into CES's chassis. My <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a> is twelve inches wide, but 17cm, or 6.75" of the width
will
be
eaten up by the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">motherboard</a>.
I measured the width of the mounting rack, which turned out to be
5.75".
The remaining 5.25" on the bottom panel didn't seem like enough space
to
acccomidate the rack, but I had an idea to make it fit. My plan for
mounting
the drives into CES is to first attach four mounting spacers onto the
bottom
panel. These spacers will be two inch-long tubes that are bolted onto
the
bottom panel at one end, and bolted to four mounting screw holes on the
other end. I was going to use four straight spacers, but the two
spacers
on the left side would have run into the right edge of the motherboard.
To fix this, I now plan to use two straight spacers on the right side
of
the mounting rack, and two S-shaped spacers on the left. This way, the
left spacers will be closer on the bottom to the right spacers, and
miss
the motherboard by millimeters. As for the hard drive, it will be
bolted
to the drive cooler, which itself will be bolted to the bottom panel. I
found that even though the spacers will be closer together, there will
still be plenty of room for the hard drive to fit between them and
under
the mounting rack.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
This evening,
I decided
to give my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch1%28White%29.jpg">white
Pen-touch pen</a> one last chance to prove it was worth at least
SOMETHING
to me. I tried the same <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> method I used on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel03.jpg">left
panel</a>'s <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow04.jpg">down
arrow</a> once again, but this time on the angle irons. I began
with
the
Koopa Troopa angle iron, because it had three white parts, as opposed
to
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">Fire
Flower beam</a>, which had only the one oval-shaped white part.
This
way,
I could start with the harder angle iron, and then move on to the
easier
one. Before I began, I tested the tape to see how much Micron ink would
come off when I eventually removed the tape. Only some of the ink came
off, so I decided it was safe to proceed.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I put two
pieces of
tape over the Koopa Troopa vertically and slightly overlapping each
other,
and then I taped the beam to the table with five pieces of tape. I used
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a> to score the three pixel shell highlight, and then the eye.
The
bottom edge of one of the pieces of tape clipped the bottom of the
white
shell edge, so <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2916.jpg">I
added a third, shorter piece of tape</a>, which I oriented
horizontally.
I then scored the shell's edge. When all of the edge of the white areas
were scored, I used the tip of the blade and a pair of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Tweezers.jpg">round-tipped
tweezers</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2917.jpg">remove
the tape</a> over the white areas, but I ended scratching the
aluminum
in the process. But I figured that the scratches would be covered up by
the white pen's ink.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I began to
apply the
white ink on the eye, but the pen seemed to be <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2918.jpg">leaking
under the tape</a>. I stopped using the pen immediately and then
switched
to Plan B. I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
to finish the job, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2919.jpg">filling
in all the white areas</a>. Fortunately, the Wite-Out did not
appear to
leak under the tape. I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2920.jpg">removed
the tape from the beam</a>, but removing all three pieces proved
to be
tricky. It was tough to get under the tape without causing any further
scratching, and when I did get some tape off, it tore off into smaller
pieces. This meant that I needed several tries to get all of the tape
off.
After the tape was gone, I could see that the leak from the pen wasn't
as bad as I thought it would be, and I figured I could fix it easily.
However,
I had another problem. When I removed the tape, it took some of the
Micron
ink with it, giving the turtle's shell a more faded look. This will be
a little more tricky to fix.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I then
noticed that
I missed the top-most pixel on the eye, and the corner pixel on the
shell's
highlight. I put a tiny piece of tape over each of these two areas, cut
out the tape over the missed pixels, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2921.jpg">filled
them in with the Wite-Out</a>. There were still a few tiny areas
that
needed
some white, so I touched a toothpick to the Wite-Out brush, and used it
to fill in those areas. It's just after 8PM, and I'm feeling a little
tired
now. So I'm going to leave the beam on the table, clean up the kitchen
a bit, and get some sleep. I'll trust myself a lot more with those <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">Microns</a>
once I'm fully rested.</font> </p>

- A
little
after 4:30AM today, I began testing the double coat of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Chartpak_Acrylic.jpg">Chartpak
clear gloss spray</a> on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern04.jpg">second
test panel</a>. First, I tested to see how well the coating
protected
the
Sharpie and Pigma Micron pattern from rubbing off. I rubbed an eraser
hard over a few of the guiding lines, but the coating held. When I
rubbed
the eraser against the checkerboard pattern, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern05.jpg">one
of the red squares began to rub off</a>. Apparantly, that part of
the
panel
was not smooth as I was applying the coating. Sensing the Chartpak
coating
may not be ideal for CES, I then tested the coating's ability to resist
scratching. I rubbed a smooth part of the panel with my fingernail, and
the coating scratched off very easily. I then rubbed the eraser over
where
the coating was peeling off, and this further shredded the coating, but
oddly enough, the line under it only partially faded. I then scratched
at the checkerboard pattern with my fingernail, causing some of it to
come
off without much resistance. I knew right then and there that the
Chartpak
clear gloss spray was a failure, at least for CES. I don't know what
kind
of coating to use on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Side_Panels02.jpg">my
panels</a> now; I may end up taking Mishra's advice and using
clear
tape
as my protection, but only as a last resort.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Throughout
the morning
hours until around 8:30, I was working on two e-mails that will
hopefully
generate responses that will be helpful towards my project. After
running
a certain <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>
search,
I came upon a site called finishing.com
that specializes in applying finishing coats to metal surfaces. I
found
a message board, and asked about an alternative coating to my side
panels
and angle irons. If anyone replies to my post, I hope I finally can
find
the perfect coating to protect my paintjobs.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I also
e-mailed <a href="http://www.slipperyskip.com/" target="_top">Jeffrey
Stephenson</a>, the builder of the Humidor series of small case
mods,
which
look like small wooden boxes. I asked him about the size of the fan
built
into the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">Via
Epia V10000A</a> series of motherboards. I was forced to do this,
because <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/company/" target="_top">Via's
website</a> did not reveal the size of the fan on this particular
type
of motherboard. If it turns out to be 40 x 40 millimeters, I can then
order
an LED fan of the size. A few months back, I was searching Google for a
better 40mm fan than the three LED case fan on <a href="http://www.directron.com/" target="_top">Directron</a>,
when I came across a six
LED fan on a Canadian online store called ADPmods.
Two of the fan's LEDs are red, two green, and two blue, and they flash
in a particular pattern. The unit costs $15.95 in Canadian dollars, but
that's about twelve American dollars. However, I will keep Directron's
three LED fan on the budget until I buy the ADPmods fan, so I can
always
know exactly how much I'm spending.</font> </p>

- Just
after
midnight, I opened the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SDR_-_Parcel.jpg">box</a>
containing my slimline drive mounting rack. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SDR_-_Box.jpg">package</a>
contained a two-piece rack; one small piece to mount a slimline floppy
and a slimline CD drive, and the other, bigger piece to make the
smaller
one fit snugly into a 5 1/2" bay. The smaller piece was meant to fit
inside
the bigger rack, and lock into place. There were also two faceplates,
one
biege, and the other black. My <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a> is black, and the black faceplate would give it a more
integrated
look. But I'm going to use the biege plate to give my front panel some
contrast. There were also a whole bunch of different kinds of screws.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The package
also came
with something I did not expect; a slimline to IDE/FDD adapter. This is
an integrated adapter that will make both a slimline floppy drive and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Samsung_Slim_Combo_Drive_8x_DVD-Rom.jpg">CD
drive</a> work with a standard motherboard. As I said, I didn't
think
such
an
adapter would be included, which is why I put a </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Laptop_FDD_to_Standard_Slim_FDD_Adapter.jpg" target="_top">slimline
FDD adapter</a></font><font size="-2">
and a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Slim_ATAPI_to_Standard_ATAPI_Adapter.jpg" target="_top">slimline
CD to IDE adapter</a>, each costing $9.99, on the budget. But
since I
no
longer need the separate adapters, I can now take them and $19.98 off
of
the budget.</font> </p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$716.93
total
budget
- $19.98 for two adapters = $696.95 total budget</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I only paid
$29 for
this mounting rack at <a href="http://www.scsitray.com/" target="_top">MPI
Services</a> including shipping and handling, and saved myself a
bunch
of money by not buying the exact same thing at <a href="http://www.mycableshop.com/" target="_top">MyCableShop.com</a>,
who sold it for $58 not incliding S&amp;H. This is just one of many
times
that I found something online in which I thought the price was a little
high, but then decided to do a little more shopping around. I was mere
hours away from ordering the rack at MCS, when a last minute <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>
search led me to MPI, allowing me to pay a third of the price for the
EXACT
same item.</font> </p>

I tried to
slide my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
slimline CD drive</a> into the larger part of the bay, but it
wouldn't
fit into place. It was then when I noticed a piece of the smaller part
of the bay was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack02.jpg">sticking
up</a> in front of the larger bay hole, appearantly blocking it.
Also,
the part of the adapter that was supposed to fit into the back of the
CD
drive was appearantly the wrong kind. However, when I went to
Directron.com
to take a look at the Samsung DVD drive I'm getting, the connector
looked
the same as the one at the back of the adapter. The broken drive I have
is a slotload drive, but wouldn't fit into the bay, and had the wrong
connector.
But since the Samsung drive has the right connector, and does not
appear
to be a slotload drive, I'm guessing it will fit into the bay.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
When I picked
up the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">assembled
rack</a>, I found it to be a lot heavier than I was expecting it
to be.
So I went upstairs to get <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Postal_Scale01.jpg">my
mother's postal scale</a>, and tried to weigh the rack. This
wasn't as
easy as it normally is, because the rack kept slipping off the scale.
So
I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SDR_-_Separated.jpg">separated
the two pieces</a>, and weighed them separately. The smaller part
of
the
rack weighed about three and a half ounces, while the larger part was
reading
off the scale. For now, I will assume that the larger piece weighs five
ounces and a half ounces, so this adds up to a total of nine ounces.
CES's
weight is 8 lbs, 15 ounces the last time I checked, but the last time I
factored the drives into the equation, I assumed that the slim floppy
drive
plus the rack would weigh about the same as a standard floppy drive.
However,
the rack itself and a standard floppy drive weigh about the same. All I
have to do to get a good estimate on CES's current weight is to add the
weight of a slimline floppy to the total, but I don't know how much one
weighs. Just now, I used the postal scale to weigh my broken slim CD
drive
for comparison purposes, and the result was way past the four ounce
limit.
A slim floppy drive is a lot smaller than a slim CD drive, and so I
will
assume that a slim floppy drive weighs exactly five ounces, just to
play
it safe. This brings CES's current weight to 9lbs, 4 ounces. Once I
apply
the finishing coat to my 4" angle irons and side panels, I will have
all
the parts weighed again to get a more accurate official weight.</font>

- After
midnight,
I resumed work on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction01.jpg">eraser
shield</a> for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons02.jpg">angle
irons</a>. I drew every other horizontal line to form a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction02.jpg">rectangular
grid</a>. I was&nbsp;going to fill in the rest of the
horizontal lines,
but I found the grid to be mostly adequate the way it was. On the left
side of the grid, I drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction04.jpg">outline</a>
for the light green portions of the 3D blocks. I alligned the outline
vertically,
and drew two horizontal grid lines through the tip on either side. On
the
right side of the grid, I drew <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction05.jpg">all
the parts</a> I'd need to fill in the white areas of the Koopa
Troopa;
the eyes, the shell highlight, and the shell bottom. Finally, in the
middle
of the grid, I drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction06.jpg">outline</a>
of the outer rim of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">Fire
Flower</a>. After the green and white outlines of the angle irons
were
drawn, I used a pair of scissors to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction07.jpg">cut
out the gridded section</a> from the rest of the carboard sheet.</font>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I used my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction08.jpg">cut
out the outline</a> of the trapezoid pattern for the light green
sections.
In order to test the cutout, I retrieved my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Aluminum_Sheet%287x4%29.jpg">spare
side panel</a> from my bedroom, put the eraser shield over it,
and then
used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Light_Green%29.jpg">light
green Sharpie</a> to fill in as much of the cutout as I could. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Test_Mark01.jpg">resulting
pattern</a> looked pretty good, so I decided to go ahead with the
real
thing. I taped the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2933.jpg">Mario
angle iron</a> to the edge of the kitchen table in order to keep
it
from
going anywhere as I applied the ink to it. I then lined up the
trapezoid
cutout of the eraser shield over the left side of the 3D block on the
angle
iron, and used the light green Sharpie to fill in the pattern. When I
removed
the shield, I saw that the green did not completely fill in the area,
so
I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2934.jpg">filled
in the rest of the space</a> without the shield. Realizing
that I didn't need the eraser shield for the light green sections of my
angle irons, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2935.jpg">filled
in the top side</a> of the 3D block with the Sharpie, again
without the shield. After detatching the Mario
beam from the table, I taped the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2909.jpg">Coins
beam</a> in its place, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2911.jpg">filled
in the light green sections</a> of the 3D block manually.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After the
light green
sections of the angle irons were completed, I decided to work on the
white
areas next. I used my X-Acto knife to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction09.jpg">cut
out the eye section</a> of the cardboard eraser shield, but after
I
did,
I realized that the eyeball was one pixel too short, but decided to
test
the cutout anyway. So I put the cutout over the spare side panel, and
used
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch1%28White%29.jpg">white
Pen-touch marker</a> to fill in the cutout. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Test_Mark02.jpg">resulting
mark</a> was disappointing, and right then and there I lost faith
in
the
pen altogether. I then made the decision to leave the white areas of my
angle irons and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Side_Panels02.jpg">side
panels</a> blank.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
This means
that the
only color standing between me and completing my angle irons is yellow.
My original plan was to borrow a yellow Sharpie from Jen, but now that
I think of it, I'd rather spend the $2.50 or whatever on a yellow <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a> than risk ruining my nearly completed angle irons with
the
fatter
tipped Sharpie. I might even spend another $2.50 on a fresh green
Micron
to fill in the tiny down arrow on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel02.jpg">left
panel</a>, but I have one more trick up my sleeve that might save
me
the
cash. My plan for the arrow is to cover the down arrow with a small
piece
of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a>, making sure to only cover the arrow and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a> ink around it. I will then use the X-Acto knife to
VERY
CAREFULLY
score the outline of the arrow, and then peel off the arrow shaped area
of tape. Then, I'll fill in the arrow with the light green Sharpie.
This
strategy should be more accurate than the cardboard eraser shield, but
peeling off the tape once the job's done could take some of the Micron
ink with it. But even if it does, it will be all black, so redrawing it
should be very easy.</font> </p>

It's almost
6PM now,
and earlier this afternoon I took the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern04.jpg">second
test panel</a> out to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Backyard.jpg">back
yard</a>
again and sprayed it with a second coat of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Chartpak_Acrylic.jpg">Chartpak
clear gloss spray</a>. The smell of the chemicals has probably
died
down
a bit by now, and I'm going to bring it inside soon so it can finish
drying.
While waiting for the second coat to dry, I went to work on filling in
the tiny down arrow on the left panel. I took a small piece of Scotch
tape
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow01.jpg">covered
the arrow</a>, being carefull not to cover up any of the green
areas. I
then took my X-Acto knife and scored the outline of the arrow. When the
parimeter was completely scored, I used the tip of the knife to get
under
the tape so I could begin peeling off the arrow-shaped piece of tape,
and
used a pair of tweezers to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow02.jpg">pull
it off</a> the panel. Unfortunately, I ended up scratching the
panel
while
trying to get under the tape with the knife, but I was hoping that this
error would be concealed once the ink was applied. I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow03.jpg">filled
in the area</a> with the green Sharpie marker, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow04.jpg">peeled
off the rest of the tape</a> with the tweezers. The green arrow
was
fairly
accurate, except for a bit of missing green on the left wing of the
arrow.
Using the carboard eraser shield as an edge, I was able to fill in the
missing green without crossing over to the black pixels. As it turns
out,
the Sharpie did in fact cover up the scratches, so that's one less
thing
for me to worry about.</font> </p>

- Around
11PM
last night, I started perparing the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern01.jpg">second
top hatch scrap panel</a> for testing the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Chartpak_Acrylic.jpg">Chartpak
protective coating</a> that I may eventually use on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Side_Panels02.jpg">side
panels</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons02.jpg">four
inch angle irons</a>. I used my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">ruler</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a> to draw a grid, but not of squares this
time.
Instead,
I drew grid lines 1/16" apart on one orientation, and 1/8" on the
other,
resulting in a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern02.jpg">grid
of rectangles</a>. I then filled in the grid with a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern03.jpg">pattern
of the different colors</a> of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpies%28Green&amp;Black%29.jpg">Sharpies</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">Pigma
Microns</a>. When the pattern was finished, it had a black border
made
of both Micron and Sharpie ink, a light/dark green Sharpie checkerboard
pattern on either side, and various colors of Micron rectangles in the
middle.</font> </p>

Around 3:15
this afternoon,
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/SDR_-_Parcel.jpg">slimline
drive mounting rack</a> from <a href="http://www.scsitray.com/" target="_top">MPI
Services</a> arrived. I'm not going to open it until I finish painting
the angle irons and the side panels, because I already have that and my
<a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>
studies to worry about, and I don't want to spread myself too thin.
This
rack will be crucial in determining the exact postion of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>, and the exact size of the hole for the drives in the
panel.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After 7PM, I
took
the Chartpak clear gloss spray and the second test panel down to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Backyard.jpg">back
yard</a>, and sprayed on the first coating. The coating claims to
be
fast
drying, and it's almost 9PM, so I think I'll go down and bring it
inside,
assuming no animals have dragged it away. I just hope the smell of the
spray isn't too powerful. Tomorrow morning, when I'm sure the coating
is
dry, I'll spray a second layer on the panel, and when that dries, I'll
run a few tests on it.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's after
9PM, and
just brought in the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_-_Test_Pattern04.jpg">test
panel</a> from outside. The panel's chemical smell has almost
gone
away,
and it feels only slightly sticky. I'm not sure if it counts as dry,
but
just to play it safe, I'm going to wait until daybreak to apply the
second
layer of the coating. After it dries again, I'll run the same tests I
did
on the first panel.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Early this
morning,
I began work on an eraser shield for my angle irons. I took an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/L-shaped_Cardboard_Sheet.jpg">already
used piece of cardboard</a> from our kitchen newspaper closet,
and drew
all of the guiding dots before going to bed. I figured that 2 x 4
inches
would do the trick, and since it was for areas on the angle irons, I
drew
the dots 1/16" apart. Just now, I finished the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES02_-_Construction01.jpg">vertical
lines</a>, a task that took me over an hour to complete. The
horizontal
lines will be longer than the vertical ones, but the task will be less
tedious because there will be half as many of them.</font>
