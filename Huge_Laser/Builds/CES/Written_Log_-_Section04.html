<hr width="100%">
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/12/2004 - In the
pre-dawn
hours of this morning, I was studying my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel02.jpg">front
panel</a>, and trying to figure out exactly how to mount the
switches
and
LED shades. I found that the best way to do this is to mount the
<a href="http://www.schweppes.com/" target="_top">Schweppes</a>
bottle top first on the middle left edge. Once that is done, I can
figure
out exactly where to cut the hole for the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font><font size="-2">,
which will be just above bottle top. While playing
around
with
my front panel components, I found that <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">the
red cap</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap_On_RsB.jpg">fit
so neatly over the reset button</a>, it could be used to
easily
mark the location of the reset button hole. The button won't stick very
far out of the panel, but I think that cutting the hole at an inward
angle
on each of the four sides might give a finger more room to push the
button.
I plan to see if I can do this without ruining the panel by doing a
test
on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Top_Half.jpg">top
half of the cart piece</a>. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_Cut_Rails01.jpg">rectangular
holes</a> that were already on the back of the cart piece are
very
close
in size to the future reset button hole. After cutting off the
protrusions
that are on either side of one of the holes, I will poke the reset
button
into it from the back, and see how well it sticks through the front.
I'll
then cut around the four sides hole at an inward angle to see if I can
make the hole bigger without ruining the plastic around it. If I can do
this, I will cut the hole for the reset button in the same manner.
Finally,
I will cut the two holes for the LED shades below the Schweppes bottle
top, making sure the bottle top is squarely in between the two. After I
cut the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Clear_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">clear
lipstick cap</a> down to the size of the red
cap, both will then be glued into place. Since the locations of the
buttons and switches are going to revolve around the Schweppes bottle
top,
I'll have to wait until I finish drinking an entire <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottles.jpg">2
liter bottle</a> before using its top. I'm about two thirds
through one
of the bottles now, so hopefully I can finish it soon.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/11/2004 - And
now
for the shortest report so far this month. I just ordered the Creamy
Entertainment
System's aluminum chassis parts from </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a></font><font size="-2">.
The price of the materials was $49.16, and fortunately there was no
tax.
I chose the cheapest available shipping method, which was <a href="http://www.ups.com/" target="_top">UPS</a>
Ground, and after that was factored in, my total cost turned out to be
$60.37. I'm using my mother's <a href="http://www.capitalone.com/indexrfa.php" target="_top">Capital
One</a> credit card to pay for the order, with her
permission of
course, and I left her $61 because it's more convenient than dealing
with
change. Spending $61 altogether, rather than $49.16 for the materials
alone
raises the project's budget by $11.84.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/10/2004 - A
little
after 2:30 this morning, I resumed work on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel01.jpg">front
panel</a>'s drive holes. After I finished chiseling dents around
the
inner
parimeter of the slimline CD drive bay, I completed the holes by
chiseling
them through the back of the panel. After a little confusion on how to
continue, I began to work on the drive hole's corners, which proved to
be a bit more difficult to complete. It was basically more chiseling
and
cutting, just a lot more intense than the initial holes. Next, I had to
deal with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay_Cutting02.jpg">protruding
sections</a> on the back of the panel, which intercepted my
parimeter
of
holes in six places. But like the circle I had to deal with while
cutting
out the panel itself, they weren't all that hard to chisel through. The
rest was just a matter of playing <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay_Cutting03.jpg">connect-the-dots</a>
with the parimeter holes with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Yellow_Box_Cutter.jpg">box
cutter</a>, then using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Thin_Screwdriver.jpg">thin
screwdriver</a> and
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Rubber_Mallet.jpg">rubber
mallet</a> to chisel out <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay.jpg">the
rest of drive bay hole</a>. I soon found that the drive bay hole
was
not
only a little crooked, but also <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_BSCDD_No_Fit.jpg">a
bit too small</a> for <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">my
broken ThinkPad CD drive</a>. I've already made the bay hole a
little
less
crooked through a bit of chiseling and planing the edges, but I still
have
to make the hole big enough for the drive to fit. It's 7:45AM, and I'm
too tired to work anymore for now, so I'll get myself a little shut-eye
before continuing any further.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; This
afternoon, I
continued to fine tune my front panel's CD drive bay. The hole was too
short and too narrow for my ThinkPad CD drive to fit through, so I had
to make it bigger. So I used the box cutter to gradually plane the
bottom
of the hole bigger wider. I soon realized this wasn't going to be
practical,
so using&nbsp;</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">my
favorite ruler</a></font><font size="-2">, I drew a new cut line about a millimeter
below
the hole. I then used the box cutter widen the hole. I also had to make
the hole longer by cutting several millimeters out of it's left side. I
accidentally made <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Crack02.jpg">another
crack</a> in my panel, but a little bit of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glue</a> took care of that. I kept gradually making the hole
bigger
until
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_BSCDD_In_Bay.jpg">CD
drive could fit through</a>. This was another all day job, and
I've got <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Table_Mess%281-10-2004%29.jpg">the
mess</a> to prove it.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I've made a
slight
change to my plans for my drive bays. Originally, I was going to mount
the floppy drive just below the CD drive, without leaving any space
between
them. But now, I think I'll separate them by about two or three
millimeters
of space. Speaking of drives, I haven't yet figured out how to mount
the
floppy drive and the hard drive to my skeleton. Until I know for sure,
I'm going to refrain from cutting the floppy drive bay hole in my front
panel. I'm either going to use some of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Mounting_Brackets.jpg">3.5"
mounts</a>, or just buy a two-drive mount online.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/9/2004 -
Yesterday
afternoon, I took another run through my mother's dresser drawers in
search
of a clear shade for my power LED in order to take the place of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Cap.jpg">Pepsi
bottle cap</a>. I managed to find <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Clear_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">another
unused lipstick cap</a>, but this one was completely
transparent,
as opposed to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/White_LipStick_Cap.jpg">lipstick
cap</a> that's now a part of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">my
custom made power button</a>. At first, I was going to use an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/White_Plug.jpg">unknown
plug-like object</a> as the shade, but I feel the LED will shine
better
through the clear lipstick cap. All I have to do is hacksaw down the
cap
to the size of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">red
HDD shade</a> and it will be ready to glue to my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel01.jpg">front
panel</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Late last
night and
through midnight this morning, I was about to save my <a href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">Veo</a>'s
photos to my project's Original photos directory on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>,
and was viewing the directory's images with Paint Shop Pro 4, when I
noticed
that there weren't as many pictures as there should have been. So as a
measure of caution, I created a sub-directory and copied the files to
it.
Then, I downloaded the photos from the camera to the Original
directory.
My fears were confirmed as I watched file after file get overwritten,
because
my files were named 'pic01', 'pic02', etc., and the camera was naming
the
new files 'pic##' starting at 01, rather than starting one pic higher
than
my last 'pic##'. If I hadn't noticed the problem, I would have
permanently
lost the pics I took of me cutting down the front panel, and those are
pics I obviously can't retake. This wasn't always a problem, because I
used to save the files onto a special album on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg" target="_top">Glamdring</a>,
a method which managed the filenames and prevented unwanted overwrites.
From that special directory, I would then copy the files onto Original
on Candybox. But since I started copying the files directly onto
Candybox
after my dumpster diving expedition, I've been unknowingly overwriting
files and losing my photo log. However, the problem isn't as bad as you
might think. In addition to saving my recorded progress on the sawing
of
the front panel, I also remembered that I put a lot of this month's
pics
into a zip file. When I took a look at those pics, I found that all the
pics from my dumpster diving adventure to some I took of my then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Assorted_LEDs.jpg">unopened
LED pack</a>
were safe. The only pics I really lost were the ones where I was
testing the new LEDs. So from now on, every time I download pics from
the camera
onto Candybox, they will be saved to a new sub-directory.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's 11:30PM,
and
I'm still working on cutting out the drive bays from CES's front panel.
However, before I could start cutting, I used a small white GTFM ruler
to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Measurement02.jpg">verify
that the cut lines for the drive bays were straight</a>. They
were
uneven,
so I had to redraw them before continuing. Because the drive holes were
in an enclosed space, using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Hacksaws.jpg">hacksaws</a>
was out of the question. So used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Yellow_Box_Cutter.jpg">box
cutter</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Rubber_Mallet.jpg">rubber
mallet</a> to perform the chisel method to cut out the drives,
starting
with the slimline CD drive bay. Playing it safe, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay_Cutting01.jpg">chiseled
along the inner edge</a> of the cut lines. However, I soon
developed a
problem. When I reached the right edge of the panel, a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Crack01.jpg">small
crack</a> began to form on the edge of the panel. So I put an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Eraser_Under_FrP.jpg">eraser
under the crack</a> and continued to chisel, and the crack didn't
get
any
bigger as I worked. I plan to put some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glue</a> in the crack to fix it, and I'll possibly even attach a
thin
metal
plate over it to further ensure it doesn't cause me any more problems.
I will continue to work on the panel past midnight, so I'll have to
continue
updating my progress tomorrow.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/8/2004 - When I
was
down in the basement pantry last night, I was putting away some&nbsp;</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a></font><font size="-2"> bottles
I'd bought that day, when I noticed that some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottles.jpg">Schweppes
bottles</a> on the floor. These bottles were green and had white
caps,
a perfect color combination for my power button front panel sheath.
When
I finish the 2 liter Pepsi that's currently in the fridge, my next soda
will be the Schweppes. When I'm done with that, I will hack off the top
of the bottle, and use it as my new power button sheath, replacing the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Today, I was
hard
at work on chopping down my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece.jpg">shopping
cart piece</a>, and let me tell you, it wasn't nearly as quick
and easy
as I thought it would be. At around 6:30PM, I used a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Long_Hacksaw.jpg">hacksaw</a>
to cut a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Notches.jpg">small
notch on either side</a> of the cart piece 4 inches from the
bottom. In
order to make the sawing easier, I put the blade end of a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Yellow_Box_Cutter.jpg">box
cutter</a> on the outer edge of the cut line just beyond the
notch I
just
cut. I then used a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Rubber_Mallet.jpg">rubber
mallet</a> and pounded the back end of the box cutter, etching a
small
dent on the line. I made a few more dents along the cut line with this
method, and the dents were about a quarter to half an inch apart. I
then
used a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Thin_Screwdriver.jpg">thin
screwdriver</a> and the mallet to deepen the dents in the
chiseling
manner
as with the box cutter. When I did this, the dents were deep enough to
be <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Back_Dents.jpg">seen
from the back of the panel</a>. Interchanging between <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Hacksaws.jpg">two
hacksaws</a>, I sawed down as far down the cut line as I could,
and the
dents were really making the job easier. But that's when I hit a snag.
After sawing down about a third of the way down, the back of the
hacksaw <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Hacksaw_Limit.jpg">hit
the edge of the panel</a>, preventing me from sawing any further
down.
I repeated the chiseling and hacksawing a third of the way down on
the
other side again, but after that, I was at a loss about how to
continue.
Not entirely sure that I knew what I was doing, I used the box cutter
and
screwdriver chiseling method for the middle third of the line, then
made
a slash along the line with the box cutter. Because the new middle
dents
were visible from the back of the panel, I used the dents as a guide
and
I slashed across them. The final obstacle was the protruding circle at
the back of the panel, which was the toughest part to cut through. It
was
fairly easy for me to use the screwdriver to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Circle_Chisel.jpg">chisel
through the circle</a>. Once the circle was out of the way, I
only
needed
a few more slashes to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Bending.jpg">bend
the cart piece</a> at the cut line. After taking a couple of
snapshots
of this bending, I finally broke the cart piece into two pieces. As a
final
step, I sanded down the edge to get rid of the fraying and to make it
smoother.
The whole process was far more of a bitch than I could have ever
imagined;
it took me about four and a half hours to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel01.jpg">get
the job done</a>. I'm not going to bother cleaning up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Table_Mess01%281-8-2004%29.jpg">the
mess</a> I made getting my front panel to this point, because
tomorrow,
I will cut out the drive bay holes.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/7/2004 - I went
to
Jen and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house
to
babysit the kids for a little while, and brought my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Assorted_LEDs.jpg">LED
pack</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Cap.jpg">Pepsi
bottle cap</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Red_Checker.jpg">checker</a>,
a <a href="http://www.duracell.com/" target="_top">Duracel</a>
AA
battery, a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red&amp;Yellow_Cable.jpg">red
and yellow cable</a>, my <a href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">Veo</a>,
and some red, caplike <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">piece
of plastic</a> that came with a floor lamp I got for Christmas.
Using
my
fingers, I held each of the exposed wires of one end of the cable to
each
terminal of the battery, and touched the wires on the other end of the
cable to one of my small green LEDs. Nothing happened, and I couldn't
figure
out why. When JD got back home, he helped me light the LED. He stripped
one end off of the cable with <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Saphire_Swiss_Army_Knife.jpg">my
big sapphire Swiss Army Knife</a>. He then took the two AAs out
of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Lumilite_K-2AA.jpg">flashlight</a>
on my keychain, and had me hold the positive end of one battery to the
negative end of the other, while holding the end of the red wire to the
positive end of the front battery, and the yellow wire to the negative
end of the back battery. While I was doing that, JD touched the LED to
the now exposed wires on the other end of the cable. The light lit for
the first time, and when we tried shining it through the&nbsp;</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a></font><font size="-2"> cap, it
appeared dimly from under the cap. When we lit up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED01.jpg">the
LED that appeared to be white</a>, it turned out to really give
off a
red
glow.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; After I got
home,
I decided to experiment further with the LEDs. I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Electrical_Tape.jpg">electrical
tape</a> to attach one end of the cable to two batteries in the
same
manner
I did at JD's place. I then wrapped the wires on the other end of the
cable
to various LEDs. In order to see the glow of the LED's more clearly, I turned off the lights in the kitchen.
From
my experiments with the LEDs, I found that the white-sheathed red LEDs
were brighter than the red-sheathed red LEDs. I also discovered that
none
of the LEDs shined brightly enough through the Pepsi cap for my tastes.
So here's what I now plan to do for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Parts%281-7-2004%29.jpg">front
panel</a>. I will use the white-sheathed red LED as my HDD light,
and
cover
it with the red plastic cap that came with my floor lamp. For my power
light, I will use a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED01.jpg">green
LED</a>, and use a clear shade, possibly an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/White_Plug.jpg">unknown
plug-like object</a> I found weeks ago. There were no blue LEDs
in the
pack, so that's why I'm using a green one now. When I have the time,
I'll
change the cut lines in my front panel to accommodate the new covers.
(It's
a damn good thing I didn't rush to cut out the holes for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a> and the checker. :)) I'll also need to adapt the
green
and
red LEDs to fit my motherboard. The change in lampshades turns out to
be
surprisingly convenient, because the new shades will be smaller than
the
Pepsi cap and checker, meaning I no longer have to worry about weather
or not they'll fit on my front panel.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Tomorrow, the
first
thing I plan to do with my new LEDs is test their brightness with a AA
battery as <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
suggested
earlier today. I will take the two brightest LEDs, which I suspect will
be the two white ones, and test them to see if they shine through my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Cap.jpg">Pepsi
cap</a>. If they pass the test, I will cut my second
motherboard cable in half, strip down the ends, and solder
the two
cable halves to the two LEDs. Since I have no experience in soldering,
I will ask for JD's supervision in doing so. I will then proceed to cut
out the holes for two <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top.jpg">Pepsi
bottle tops</a> in my front panel, saw off the top of a second
<a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a>
bottle,
and glue in the bottle tops. If the LEDs fail the test, I'll still
prepare
the second cable for use, but I'll use the colored LEDs (green for the
power light, and red for the HDD) instead of two whites, and replace
the
power LED's Pepsi bottle top for a clear shaded cover. I'll also see if
I can find a soda bottle with a green ring around the top, so I can use
that to surround the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a>, replacing the blue-ringed Pepsi bottle top I already
have.
That way, the green-ringed power button guard will match the green
power
LED.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/4/2004 - At
around
2:00 this morning, I started marking the cut lines on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece.jpg">front
piece of a shopping cart</a> as the first step of converting it into
the
front
panel of CES. The first mark I made was a horizontal line all the way
across
the panel, exactly four inches off the bottom. Next, I used my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a> and a
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Red_Checker.jpg">checker</a>
as guides to mark two circles in the bottom left corner where the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a> and power light will go. I was going to make a small
rectangle
where the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font><font size="-2">
was going to stick through the panel, but I couldn't
determine
its exact location. I also decided to leave out the hole for the HDD
light
for the time being. The last lines I drew where the ones for the CD
drive
and the floppy drive; I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
laptop CD drive</a> from my <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/" target="_top">IBM</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/?cid=SEO-thinkpadcom" target="_top">ThinkPad</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
and my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Floppy_Drive.jpg">broken
floppy drive</a> as guides. My next step now is to cut the cart
piece
at
the 4" line, getting a better feel of the true size of the panel. Next,
I'm going to cut out the Floppy and CD drive bays, making sure my
broken
drives will fit neatly into them. However, I'm going to leave out the
power
and reset buttons for now. I have two reasons for doing this. First, the
power button and power light will both use a <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a> bottle top. Since I
currently have only one such top, I had to use the checker as a
substitute,
because it's close in size to the bottle top. I'm not sure if it's a
close
enough substitute, so I'm going to decapitate another Pepsi bottle
before
cutting the holes in my panel. Second, I have yet to test an actual LED
light to see if it will shine brightly enough through the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Cap.jpg">Pepsi
cap</a> and checker for me to use them as my lampshades. If
they're
not,
I'll have to either find brighter lights, or a thinner shades.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Sometime this
afternoon,
I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Candybox_LEDs.jpg">took
the front panel off</a> of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>
in the hopes of seeing if the LEDs could shine through my Pepsi cap. I
was disappointed to see that all of Candybox's front panel LEDs were
soldered
on to the front panel, making my shine test impossible. I'll just have
to find another way to see if I can use my Pepsi cap as a good
lampshade
for a motherboard LED.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I visited Jen
and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house today, and I brought along my front piece of shopping cart in the hopes
that JD could help me saw it down. He suggested that a table saw would
not be the ideal tool for cutting plastic, and that an ordinary hacksaw
would do the job just fine. I told him that I was concerned that a
motherboard
LED may not be able to shine through my Pepsi cap, and of the test I
tried
to do earlier to find that out. So he browsed the Web, and it took him
about a minute to come up with a site that sold different kinds of
LEDs,
including a pack of 20 assorted LEDs for less than five bucks.
Unfortunately,
the LEDs in the pack didn't come motherboard-ready and that meant that I'd have to solder an
MB
cable to one of the LEDs in order to use it. JD suggested that <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/" target="_top">Radio
Shack</a> would be a good place to look for such a LED pack. I
could
just
go with my original plan to just order a pair of LEDs online, but as I
said, the LEDs may not be bright enough, and that would be a waste of
four
bucks right there. So tomorrow after work, I'll head on down to Radio
Shack
and see if they have the LED pack, as well as anything else I can use
for
this project. I don't know exactly how much I'm going to spend on this
pack, so I won't factor its cost into my budget until after I buy it.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/3/2004 - This
afternoon,
a 26 year old kid went on his first ever dumpster diving expedition. I
packed <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">my
trusty ruler</a> and my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Toolkit.jpg">PC
repair toolkit</a>, and walked to my local <a href="http://www.apsupermarket.com/" target="_top">A&amp;P</a>.
After buying batteries for my <a target="_top" href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera">Veo</a>,
some <a href="http://www.hottamales.com/" target="_top">Hot
Tamales</a>,
and having a pizza lunch, I went to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/A&amp;P_Back_Lot.jpg">back
of the strip mall</a> and looked in some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dumpsters01.jpg">various
dumpsters</a> for a potential front panel for my Creamy
Entertainment
System.
I was looking for a thin but sturdy piece of sheet metal or plastic
that
was at least 12" x 4". <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dumpster_Contents01.jpg">One
dumpster</a> had some pink plastic container, which I think was
too
short
for me to use. Even if I could, it was too far down for me too reach
without
stepping into the dumpster. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dumpster_Contents02.jpg">Another
dumpster</a> had some black plastic electronic device I couldn't
recognize,
but again, it was too far down reach without messing myself up. A
search
of the remaining dumpsters yielded no results. I noticed some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Poison_Box.jpg">black
plastic box</a> lying on the grass just beyond the pavement, but
a
closer
examination made me think twice about touching it. Written on the box
in
big bold letters was "POISON DO NOT TOUCH", and so I heeded its warning
and moved on. I exited the back lot empty handed, and I was sure I'd
have
to come back some other time to try again. But when passed by the front
door of the A&amp;P, I saw a shopping cart with all sorts of junk
in
it.
I rummaged through it lightly, and I found an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece.jpg">unused
front piece of a shopping cart</a>, the piece that usually has
the ads.
The plastic seemed reasonably sturdy, and when I measured the piece on
site, it was just over a foot long. The rounded corners were also a
nice
touch. However, the only flaw I saw in the object was that it had some
rectangular holes in it, but I figured I could get around that. I chose
not to take a picture of the scene, because I think I was already
drawing
enough attention to myself as it was. The cart piece had <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Back%28Dirty%29.jpg">some
cobwebs and a little dirt</a> on it, but at least it didn't
smell.
After
returning home, I washed the cart piece with soap and a scrubber to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Back%28Clean%29.jpg">clean
it off</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; When I was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_LED_Measurement.jpg">measuring</a>
the LED covers and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">switches</a>
to the cart piece, I at first thought the border would get in the way
of
the components, so I considered removing it. The border cut a half inch
into the panel, which cut off a lot of space for the components, and
pushed
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a>'s screw hole over the top of the skeleton. However,
changing
my front panel's design so that the reset button lies sideways fixed
that
problem. Because cart piece's left border forces me to slide the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power</a>
and reset buttons, and the LEDs to the right half an inch, and because
the reset button will now be on its side, I'll have to adjust the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_-_Skeleton_Holes.jpg">hole
pattern in my skeleton</a> accordingly.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">12/31/2003 - It's
14
minutes before the new year, and I've just finished drawing a
simulation
of the side panels of CES. I took a blank piece of printing paper, then
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim01.jpg">drew
a 4" x 7" rectangle</a> on it with the help of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">my
favorite ruler</a>. I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim02.jpg">drew
dots down and across the edges of the rectangle</a>, five
millimeters
apart,
and used those dots to draw a 36 x 16 square grid. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim03.jpg">vertical
lines</a> were drawn first, because it was more tedious to draw
36
lines
than to draw 16, and I wanted to get the hard part out of the way
quickly.
Once the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim04.jpg">grid
was completed</a>, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim10.jpg">filled
in the grid</a> with the appropriate colors with colored pencils.
Jen
arrived
late in the night to accompany me for the new years, and she brought
over
some colored pencils for me to borrow. The sim panel looks good, and I
think I'll go with this method with the real thing, but with permanent
markers. Instead of putting the name of the computer on the bottom of
the
side panel like I was planning before, I will now put it on the top
above
the flames. After the grid is completely filled in, I plan to use small
