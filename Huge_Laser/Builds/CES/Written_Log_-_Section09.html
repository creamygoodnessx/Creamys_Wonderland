<hr width="100%">
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">6/15/2004 - It's
almost
3:30 in the afternoon, and I'm just about to start putting together
CES's
left top hatch door. I'm going to build this door a little differently
from how I built the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Door.jpg">right
door</a>. This time, I'm going to leave the protective tape on
the
aluminum
panel, and the packaging paper on the lexan panel, in order to reduce
unwanted
scratching. The last time I worked on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Doors02.jpg">top
hatch</a>, I had made marks for the drill holes on the underside
of the
left door, where light-colored tape was used. I plan to drill the holes
in the aluminum panel without the corresponding lexan panel. Once the
holes
are drilled, I will place the aluminum panel with the black tape facing
upwards, on top of the lexan panel. I'll then drill through the drilled
holes in the aluminum panel, and into the lexan.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after 9:30PM
right now, and I've finished drilling the holes in the top hatch's left
aluminum panel, but things didn't go too smoothly. The corner bolt hole
for the roller catch was WAY too high despite my best effort to keep it
low. I had to do so much correcting that the hole ended up with an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/LtH_-_Oblong_Hole.jpg">oblong
shape</a>. I also had do to some corrections to the hinge bolt
holes,
but
they weren't as severe as the corner roller catch hole. I used a
different
method for drilling the hinge bolt holes for this door than I did for
the
right door. Instead of drilling each hole while periodically checking
them
by putting the corresponding hinges over them, I drilled a hole at one
of the ends, and then bolted the appropriate hinge hole into place. I
then
put the hinge in the right position by pressing the edge of the hinge
evenly
against the edge of the panel, and this told me where the hinge's other
two bolt holes should go if the hinge was to go on straight. I then
drilled
the holes with progressively larger drill bits until I had holes that
were
just the right size to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/LtH_-_Construction01.jpg">fit
the bolts in place</a>. One thing I noticed as I worked was that
the
drill
chewed through the aluminum a lot more easily than it chewed through
the
brass hinges. In fact, the only damage the drill did to the hinges was
peel back a sharp section, so I may have to file it down someday. All I
have to do now is make the matching holes in the lexan panel, then
clean
debris from the panels, remove the protective tape/paper, and then
clean
up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Table_Mess%286-15-2004%29.jpg">the
mess</a> on the kitchen table.</font> </p>

-
Yesterday
evening, I continued to work on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a>. I was originally going to do this some weekend
at <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house, but I've come to realize that I don't really need his fancy high
end equipment to get the job done. After laying out the protective
newspaper
on the table, I used my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-acto
knife</a> to saw away the small bits of metal that still held the
middle
of one of my hatch doors in place. If you recall from an earlier log
entry,
I used a Dremel to cut the perimeter of the windows in the aluminum,
but
didn't saw out the corners in fear of damaging the outer part of my
panels.
When I began sawing the corner sections of the panel, I didn't know if
the X-acto knife was going to be able to complete the perimeter cut,
but
slowly the corner grooves met, and the middle section <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Cut04.jpg">began
to separate</a> from the outer section. Some parts were tough to
saw
through,
so I used a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Thin_Screwdriver.jpg">thin,
flat screwdriver</a> and a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Rubber_Mallet.jpg">rubber
mallet</a> to chisel them out, a similar method I used to build
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>. Eventually, I was able to sever all of the bits of aluminum connecting the panel's inner section to its outer section, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Cut05.jpg">remove
the inner section</a> from the panel. After I cut out the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Cutouts01.jpg">middle
sections</a> of
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Panels04.jpg">both
aluminum top hatch panels</a>, I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Postal_Scale01.jpg">my
mother's postal scale</a> to weigh the sections to see how much
weight
was coming off of my computer. The sections weighed three and a half
ounces,
which was exactly what I'd predicted nearly a month ago.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After taking
the </font><a href="http://consumer.schlage.com/brands/iveshome.htm" target="_top"><font size="-2"></font></a><font size="-2"><a href="http://professional.iveshardware.com/" target="_top">Ives</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Ives_Middle_Hinges01.jpg">middle
hinges</a> and one of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Roller_Catches01.jpg">roller
catches</a> out of their packages, I used a Penstix black marker
to
mark
the drill holes on my aluminum hatch doors. The </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Concave_Brass_Knobs.jpg">brass
knobs</a></font><font size="-2"> were to go in
the middle of the
inner edges of the doors, while the knob ends of the roller catches
were
to be mounted vertically above the knobs, on the underside of the
doors.
The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Hinges.jpg">hinges</a>
were to go on the underside of the outer edges of the hatch doors, so I
marked that area with six drill hole marks. When I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Panels05.jpg">made
the marks</a>, I made sure to have the less damaged sides of the
panels
facing up.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I opened up a
package
of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/8-32x1-2_Brass_Angled_Bolts.jpg">8/32"
angle head slotted screws</a> and fitted one into a hole in one
of my
hinges.
The angled part of the screw didn't seem to fit as snugly as I hoped it
would, so I put one of the hinge's wood screws in another hole for
comparison.
The wood screw <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Screws_In_Hinge.jpg">fit
in perfectly</a>, but I decided to use the ones from the separate
package,
since they were made for machining, rather than wood. So I then opened
up one of the packages of brass nuts, and used one to secure the
machine
screw to the hinge. The result was a solid fit, so I figured that I had
nothing to worry about.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
When I was
ready to
drill, I put one of my lexan panels under what would be the right
aluminum
top hatch panel, and used four pieces of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">clear
Scotch tape</a> to hold them together. I then put the panels <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes01.jpg">on
top of two of my angle irons</a> so the drill wouldn't go through
the
cutting
board I was using to protect the table. I then hammered a small nail
into
the top right hole for the roller catch. This was to create a pilot
hole
for the drill. I then fitted the smallest drill bit (a 3/32" bit) I had
to my dad's cordless <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Panasonic_Drill.jpg">Panasonic
drill</a>, and then drilled the hole through both panels. The
hole
wasn't
big enough for the 3/8" zinc bolt to fit through, so I widened the hole
with a 7/64" bit. The bolt fit into the hole perfectly, and so I
repeated
the process with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes02.jpg">roller
catch's other hole</a>. After I made the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes03.jpg">hole
for the brass knob</a>, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes04.jpg">bolted</a>
the knob and the roller catch's knob into their places. It was then
when
I realized I made a crucial error. The roller catch knob was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes05.jpg">mounted
vertically</a>, but the roller could only be mounted to the 12"
top
angle
iron horizontally. So I drilled another hole for the roller catch to
the
right of the catch's top drill hole. It was then a simple matter of
turning
the catch's knob <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Catch_Correction.jpg">90
degrees clockwise</a> so that it would use the top two drill
holes, and
be mounted horizontally. I decided it was better to leave the bottom
bolt
in place than it was to have an empty hole. In order to preserve the
top
hatch's symmetry, I will make a matching bottom roller catch bolt hole
on the left hatch door as well.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
As I worked,
I noticed
that the drill hole marks I drew for the hinges were rubbing off on my
hands. After I got tired redrawing the marks with the Penstix, I
switched
to using my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">new
pink mechanical pencil</a> instead. It was after midnight when I
started
drilling the holes for the hinges. By this time, I had removed the
Scotch
tape that was holding my panels together, because the existing bolts
were
enough to keep the panels from slipping apart. As I drilled the holes
for
the top hinge, a slip of the drill caused me to miss the mark on the
bottom
hole. I tried to correct the problem by re-adjusting the hole as I
drilled
downwards, but the drill kept slipping back into the wrong position. I
found that if I drilled at an angle towards the correct position, I
could
get the hole to end up closer to where it needed to be. At around two
in
the morning, I finished drilling the three holes, using drill bits as
large
as 5/32". I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes06.jpg">bolted
one of the middle hinges in place</a>, using three brass nuts to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes07.jpg">secure
the hinge on the topside</a>.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after three
in the afternoon right now, and I spent all day typing out this report.
I will continue to work on the hatch doors today and then record my
progress
in the following paragraphs. But before I begin, I'd like to point out
that I just took another look at the hinge I bolted on this morning,
and
seems a little crooked. If it becomes a problem, I'm not sure how I'll
fix it and still make it look good, but I'll cross that bridge when I
get
to it.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's now
after 11PM,
and I've made some good progress on my top hatch today. I planned to
bolt
one of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/JD%27s_Hinges.jpg">the
hinges that JD gave me</a> on the outer bottom corner of the
panel,
right
next to the hinge I bolted on yesterday. As I tried to drill the first
hole for the bottom hinge, the drill bit kept rolling away from where I
was trying to put the hole. After a few more tries, I drilled the first
hole with the smallest drill bit, but the hole was too low. However, I
was able to use the bigger bits to adjust the hole to it's correct
position.
The second hole was also severely off when I first drilled it, but I
managed
to correct its position too. After all three holes were drilled, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Holes08.jpg">I
bolted JD's hinge to the holes</a>, and it was a perfect fit.
Just to
make
sure the hinges weren't crooked, I pressed them against the side of the
kitchen table, and they turned out to be straight enough.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
My next step
was to
clean off the newly completed hatch door of all of the debris that was
trapped between the panels. I unbolted everything from the hatch door
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Parts.jpg">separated
the two panels</a>. I then cleaned the lexan sheet by first
wiping it
down
with a paper towel, then rinsing it off with water, and finally soaping
it it up with a sponge and rinsing it off again. As for the aluminum
panel,
I removed the tape that was still left on it, then erased
the&nbsp;remaining
pencil lines. However, doing so left marks on the panel I couldn't
remove,
even with soap. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtH_-_Door.jpg">I
re-assembled the hatch door</a>, but it was too late to start
working
on
the left door, so I'll have to take care of that after I get back from
some wedding in Canada I've been invited to.</font> </p>

for CES's photo log. After I transferred the images to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>,
disaster struck. I was in the <a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">digital

on the camera itself, I realized that I had deleted the actual images
on
Candybox, so I ended up having to re-take half the pictures.</font>

- The two
Samsung
120GB 7200RPM hard drives I ordered from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg</a>
arrived in the mail yesterday via <a href="http://www.fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a>.
I would have reported it then, but I was too busy making a full backup
of my archives and projects. I plan to install one of the drives into <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>
and move my E logical drive onto it, so my archives and projects can
have
a drive to themselves. As for the other drive, I'll keep it wrapped in
whatever individual package it's in until I'm ready to install it into
CES.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">5/26/2004
- I just
ordered
two Samsung 120GB 7200RPM hard drives from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>.
The drives were $84 each, which would have totaled $168 total, however
a tax of $10.08 brought the total up to $178.08. Since I'm once again
using
my parents' credit card to pay for my online orders, I will give them
$180,
since I don't really like dealing with change. However, only one of
these
drives is intended to be a part of the Creamy Entertainment System; the
other drive will be used in my main system, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>.
Therefore, I will only add one of them to my budget, and consider it to
be $90, which is $1.75 more than the Maxtor which I was originally
going
to buy. I could have paid less at <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/index.html" target="_top">Directron</a>
for similar drives, but the customers on NewEgg actually use the rate
and
review options unlike those at Directron, and had given the Samsung
drive
an overwhelmingly positive review. So I decided it was better to play
it
safe and spend a few dollars more for a drive that is highly likely to
last a while, at least according to the majority of the customers.</font>

By the way,
I'd like
to point out that for the first time in this project, the "items bought so
far"
section of my budget is now bigger than the "current shopping list"
section.
Based on this fact, I'd have to say that this project is more than half
way completed. However, there is still a lot of work to do, such as
building
the chassis, and this is not going to be an easy task by any means.
Also,
once I complete my Directron shopping spree, there won't be any more
than
three items left on the list, which will be quite an interesting sight.</font>

I asked my
sister
Jen recently about if she wanted to have Grandma's old clock radio that
my dad was going to throw out, but she said she really didn't have a
use
for it. So I can go ahead and start chopping it down for parts. I plan
to remove the clock's top cover and cut out a rectangle surrounding the
four button holes, and then use this rectangular cut-out as a switch
plate
for my front panel. If I find that it's not out of my league, I'll also
remove the clock's four buttons and use two of those as new switches
for
my cold cathode fan grills. So I better get it out of the <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/maxima" target="_top">Maxima</a> before
my dad chucks it.</font> </p>

Yesterday,
I was thinking about how I was going to fit the CES's name on one of
its <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Side_Panels01.jpg">side
panels</a>. I had a 10 millimeter square of space to paint each
letter,
but the letters were 7 x 7 pixels. This meant that I needed to evenly
break
down each square into a 7 x 7 grid, but none of my ruler's measurements
could do this. I could have divided each square into a 10 x 10 grid,
but
this would have meant having 7 square millimeters of letter, and then
three
millimeters of space before the next letter. This was more empty space
than I was comfortable with having, plus the letters would have been
too
small for my tastes. After much thought, I came up with a solution. If
I put a one pixel border around each letter, I could increase the size
of each letter to nine square millimeters, and have only a one
millimeter
space separating each letter. While some of the authentic feel of the
NES
font would be lost, the letters would now look so much cooler in a
two-color
state.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
In order to
see what
the name would look like once painted onto my side panel, I made a
simulation
of the name as a GIF image. Using screenshots from <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> and <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/" target="_top">The
Legend of Zelda</a>, I wrote the words "THE CREAMY ENTERTAINMENT
SYSTEM"
in three rows in the classic NES font. I drew the letters bright green
and surrounded each letter with a dark green border, using a black
background. I spaced each letter one pixel apart from each other on all
sides. As I worked, I noticed that the letters "T", "Y" and "I" were
only
six pixels across, and hugged the right edge of the block. When I
finished,
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Right_Panel02.gif">result</a>
was a 133 x 33 GIF image with the CES's name painted on it; "THE
CREAMY"
on the first row, "ENTERTAINMENT" on the second row, and "SYSTEM" on
the
bottom. I'm very happy with the way the simulation turned out, and I
plan
on somehow using fine point markers to manually transfer that image
onto
my aluminum side panels, just above the green flames.</font><font size="-2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> <font size="-2">5/21/2004
- I was
sitting on the floor of my bedroom this morning, thinking about how to
put CES's chassis together, when I peeked into my closet and saw
something
that could change the design of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>. In the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Controller_Crate.jpg">plastic
crate</a> containing my various game controllers, I noticed <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/NES_Controller.jpg">one
of my NES standard controllers</a> and an idea just hit me from
out of
the blue. What if I could use the front plate of an NES controller to
build
a front panel faceplate for CES's USB and PS/2 ports? If I could do
that,
it would dramatically enhance the retro-gaming look that I want CES to
have when I complete it. I was torn between preserving my controller
and
making CES look better. So I decided that I would only consider
chopping
down the controller if it met two criteria. First, the B and A button
holes
would have to be big enough to allow PS/2 ports to fit through them,
and
the Select and Start button holes would have to be big enough to
accommodate
USB ports. Second, the controller's faceplate had to fit into whatever
room was still available on the front panel. (Any space that was not
being
used for the left-side
buttons and LED shades, or the drives that will be in the
upper
right
corner.) So I placed the controller on top of my front panel, and it
fit
between the LEDs/buttons and the drives. Then, I went next door to my
sister's
old bedroom, and got out an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Broken_Optical_Mouse.jpg">optical
mouse</a> that recently broke on me, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/NES_USB_Comparison.jpg">compared
its USB connector to the Start button</a> on the NES controller.
The
USB
connector was bigger, but just barely, so I figured that if I decided
to
use the NES controller, I could bore the Start and Select buttons wider
without severely altering the controller's look. I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/NES_PS-2_Comparison.jpg">compared
the B and A buttons to the PS/2 end of a USB to PS/2 adapter</a>,
and
found it to be a good fit.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After putting
a little
more thought into using the controller on my front panel, I figured out
how I'm going to prepare the controller for this use, and how to mount
it within CES. First, I will take out the insides of the controller and
detach the cord. I will then gradually bore the Select and Start
buttons
wider until USB ports can fit into them. After careful measuring and
placement,
I will cut holes in the back half of the controller, and then glue two
USB ports and two PS/2 ports into place. If I do this right, when I put
the front half of the controller over the back half, the ports should
fit
perfectly into the front half's holes. I'll then cut out a 4 3/4" x
2" rectangle
in my front panel, just right of the LED covers, then glue the
controller&#8217;s
front half behind the hole. I will then use the back half's screw holes
to attach it to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Expansion_Slot_Covers.jpg">two
expansion slot covers</a> that my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">cold
cathode fan grills</a>' <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires02.jpg">old
switches</a> were mounted on. Finally, I will use the slot
covers&#8217;
screw
notches to bolt them to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">CES&#8217;s
bottom panel</a>. This way, I can remove the front panel with the
controller&#8217;s
front half, while the PS/2 and USB ports remain on the back half.</font>

In other news
today,
I finished redesigning the <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> images that I will paint on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">4&#8221;
angle irons</a>. Now, when I place the bolts through the beams,
they
will
go either through blank spaces, or blank portions of some block. This
way,
they won&#8217;t clash with the angle irons&#8217; designs. I was going to use a
Little
Goomba in one of the beams, but I&#8217;ve decided to go with a Fire Flower
instead.
I&#8217;ll be working on drawing the guide grids on the beams tomorrow, and
on
the off chance I can get to <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a>, I&#8217;ll see if I can pick up some colored <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a> fine point pens, if they exist. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll see
what I
can
borrow from Jen, if she has any fine point markers that won&#8217;t smudge
off
of aluminum.</font> </p>

- The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Roller_Catches01.jpg">roller
catches</a> I bought yesterday at the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> work in the same manner as a magnetic catch, however
the
rollers
are a much better option for holding CES's <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a> closed for two reasons. First, the rollers don't
use
magnets,
which can damage data on floppy disks. Second, rollers hold much
tighter
than magnets, so nothing short of a hearty tug will open CES's top
hatch,
which is exactly the result I want. In fact, if the roller catches hold
tight enough, I may not need a sliding latch in addition to the
rollers.
The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Screws&amp;Nuts.jpg">nuts
and bolts</a> and the catches I bought yesterday weigh about six
and a
half ounces, which is half an ounce less than the seven ounces I
thought
that 50 bolts and nuts and 1 sliding latch would weigh, so I ended up
saving
myself a little bit of weight.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Last weekend,
my parents,
my nephew Austin, and I were on our way to visit my brother Peter's
house
in southern </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.state.nj.us/" target="_top">New Jersey</a></font><font size="-2">. I noticed that my grandmother's old clock radio
was lying on the floor in the back of the car. I took a close look at
it,
and saw that there were four constant contact buttons lined up in a
horizontal
row on the top of the radio. I figured that if I could cut a 1" x 2"
section
out of the top, I could use the four button holes as a faceplate for
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/New_CCG_Switches.jpg">two
switches</a> for my
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">fan
grills</a>, plus I'd have two vacant holes if I decided to add
more
accessories
to CES in the future. If I can figure out how to disconnect the buttons
themselves from the rest of the radio, I can use them to replace my fan
grill's switches. However, my sister Jennifer has taken an apparent
interest
in saving the clock, and she may want to prevent my dad from throwing
it
out. So the next time I get a chance, I'll ask Jen if she actually
wants
to take the clock. If she says yes, I'll stick to the switches I have
or
replace them with LED switches, if I can still afford them by the time
I buy all of the <a href="http://www.directron.com/" target="_top">Directron</a>
items.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I'm making a
slight
design change to the paintjob to my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">angle
irons</a>. Instead of painting the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/Ground_Block.gif">ground
blocks</a> on the bottom of each beam, I will now paint <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/3D_Block.gif">3D
blocks</a> or <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/Spent_Question_Block.gif">spent
"?" blocks</a> in their place. These blocks have a blank center,
and
the
bolts holding the beams to the rest of the chassis may look better when
positioned through these blocks.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After giving
this
issue much thought, I've decided to forget about using a 1 gig RAM
stick
and go back to two 512MB sticks. I have two reasons for making this
decision.
First, when I upgrade CES for the 2005 <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>,
I will do a motherboard swap. The board I'm most likely going to switch
to the Intel
P4 Insight mini-itx motherboard, and with it, I can use a hard
drive
larger than 137GB, and use its ZIF socket to put in a <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/celeron/index.htm" target="_top">Celeron</a>
chip, which will have a clock speed of at least 2GHz, double that of
the <a href="http://www.viaembedded.com/en/" target="_top">Via</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">Epia
V10000A motherboard</a>. The Insight also uses a different type
of RAM,
and not the PC133 of the V10000A, so any RAM I buy for the V10000A will
be useless once the motherboard swap is complete. The second advantage
of changing RAM is that two 512MB sticks are MUCH cheaper that a single
1GB stick. In fact, Directron is now selling 512MB
sticks of PC133 RAM for $85.99 each. One thing I've learned
throughout
this project is that you can never count on the price of RAM staying
the
same for very long. If I could afford to right now, I'd buy all of the
Directron items on my list before the price of the RAM goes up or until
they're sold out, but I'm just a poor ass <a href="http://www.footlocker.com/" target="_top">Foot
Locker</a> stockroom grunt who has to wait until I have the cash
to do
so. The single 1GB RAM stick I was going to get at <a href="http://www.memory4less.com/" target="_top">Memory4Less.com</a>
for $243.27 shot up in price to over $300, so replacing that RAM for
two
$85.99 Directron 512MB RAM sticks will take a WHOPPING $71.29 off of my
budget.</font> </p>

I will no
longer be
using the combo slimline CD/floppy drives from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>.
This is because I found a better, but more expensive alternative while
surfing the Web. I came across MyCableShop.com,
where I found a CD/floppy mounting rack on which is designed to fit
into
a 5 1/4" drive bay for 58 bucks. This is a lot cheaper than the NewEgg
mounting rack, except it doesn't come with the drives, but unlike the
NewEgg
rack, it comes with adapters so that slimline drives can work on a
regular
PC. It also comes with two faceplates; one black, the other white. As
for
the drives, I will get the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Samsung_Slim_Combo_Drive_8x_DVD-Rom.jpg">Samsung
CDRW/DVD drive</a> I was planning on getting before, and also a
slimline
Mitsumi floppy drive from Directron for $26.99. With this new setup,
CES
will once again have the ability to burn CDs, and I'll have an easier
time
mounting the rack into my chassis. Now, let's calculate all of this
into
the budget...</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I'm replacing
the
$94.99 NewEgg drive rack with the $58 MCS rack, which takes $36.99 off
of the budget...</font> </p>

<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$672.20 total
budget
- $36.99 less spent = $635.21 total budget</font></p>
</center>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Because the
new drive
rack comes with adapters for the CD and floppy drives, I will no longer
need the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Slim_ATAPI_to_Standard_ATAPI_Adapter.jpg">Slimline
CD Desktop to IDE Adapter</a> from Directron...</font> </p>

<p><font size="-2">$635.21 total
budget
- $9.99 for 1 Slimline CD Desktop to IDE Adapter = $625.22 total budget</font></p>
</center>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The MCS drive
rack
does not come with drives of its own, so I'm now buying the Samsung
CDRW/DVD
drive for $81.99, and the Mitsumi floppy drive for $26.99.</font>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">5/18/2004
- I went
to
our local <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> late this afternoon, and picked up the nuts and bolts
that
will
eventually hold the Creamy Entertainment System together. Right after I
arrived at the store, I realized that I didn't bring the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/JD%27s_Hinges.jpg">hinges</a>
that <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
gave me, so
I needed to find another reference while looking for the right size
bolts.
After picking up two
brass roller catches, and then searching the aisles for about
ten
minutes,
I found a pair of the same <a href="http://professional.iveshardware.com/" target="_top">Ives</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg">broad
hinges</a> I bought on my last visit, but this time I was only
going to
use it for comparison purposes, not for buying. The nuts and bolts were
conveniently in the same aisle as the hinges, and because I had spent
some
time preparing for a trip like this over the past two days, I had a
general
idea of the bolts I needed. The roller catches each came with four wood
screws, so I picked up a 12-pack
of tiny zinc 3/8" blots with matching nuts in order to
replace the
screws. As for the bolts for the chassis, I needed 44; 24 to hold the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a> together and to the top <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">7"
angle irons</a>, and 20 for the rest of the chassis. The 24 bolts
for
the
top hatch needed to have angled heads to fit snugly through the hinges,
and with the help of someone who worked at the Depot, I found some
six-packs
of 8/32" x 1/2" brass bolts, and I got four
bags. The 20 bolts that would hold the rest of the chassis
together
had to have flat heads, so I picked up four
six-packs of those bolts, which were also 8/32" x 1/2". The
chassis
bolts did not come with their own nuts, so I bought eight
six-packs of 8/32" brass nuts.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
As for the
the bill,
my dad paid for the parts by adding them to the stuff he was buying
because
he had to cut in line for us to leave together. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Roller_Catches01.jpg">two
brass roller
catches</a>
were 69 cents each, totaling $1.38, while each of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Screws&amp;Nuts.jpg">17
bags of nuts and bolts</a> was 83 cents, totaling $14.11. The
grand
total
turned out to be $15.49, so I will give my dad $16 even to pay for the
parts. As for CES's budget, I will add $2 for the roller catches, and
$14
for the nuts and bolts.</font> </p>

After I got
home from
the Home Depot, I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Postal_Scale01.jpg">my
mother's postal scale</a> to weigh the items I bought. All the
items in
a single bag went over the scale's 4 ounce limit, so I decided to break
the weighing down into three parts. The total weight came out to be
about
six and a half ounces, and that added to CES's current 8 lb, 12 ounce
weight,
CES now officially weighs 9 pounds and two and a half ounces.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">5/12/2004
- Over
the
past few days, I've been trying to accurately estimate how much the
Creamy
Entertainment System will eventually weigh. A few days ago, I started
getting
curious as to how much the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/CES_Packages.jpg">packages</a>
I kept my parts in weighed. I keep all of CES's parts in two shoeboxes
and various plastic bags, and at first I didn't think that this would
add
too much weight to my chassis. I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Postal_Scale01.jpg">my
mother's postal scale</a> to weigh the packaging, because it's
fairly
accurate and goes up to four ounces. The first thing I weighed was the
lid of the large <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Puma_Shoebox.jpg">Puma
shoebox</a>, and was surprised to see it weigh a tad over three
ounces.
When I weighed the box itself, the result was off the scale, so I
considered
that to be four ounces. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Lexan_Parcel.jpg">bag</a>
that the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Lexan_Sheets.jpg">lexan
sheets</a> were mailed in, which was paper with a plastic bubble
wrap
inner
lining, turned out to be about an ounce. The packages in which the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">cold
cathode fan grills</a> were in weighed two ounces each with the
cardboard
sheets, so naturally both of them together are four ounces. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/HDC_-_Box.jpg">hard
drive cooler box</a> in its Ziploc bag weighed a little over an
ounce.
Finally when I weighed the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Jasmin_Shoebox.jpg">small
white Jasmin shoebox</a>, the box turned out to be three and a
half
ounces
while its lid weighed one and a half ounces. So the total weight of
everything
I weighed was around 18 ounces; a little over a pound. There were a few
more light plastic bags and paper and plastic wrappings, but I didn't
bother
to weigh them. Just for the sake of being conservative and of saving
time,
I'm going to take exactly one pound off the total weight when I
re-weigh
the items on a more accurate scale than the one I used three days ago.</font>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Just now, I
tried
to do was guess how much weight will be shaved from my chassis as the
result
of cutting holes to accommodate various parts. In order to make room
for
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Hinges.jpg">hinges</a>
on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a>, I'll need to cut a 5 x 1 inch section from the top
part of
each
of the top <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">7"
angle irons</a>. I will also have to cut 3 x 1 inch sections from
each
of the back <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">12"
beams</a> for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Fan.jpg">rear
fan</a>. This means that a total of 16 square inches will be
taken off
of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Angle_Irons01.jpg">angle
irons</a>, which is the same as two of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">4"
beams</a>. So in order to get an estimate of how much weight will
be
saved
by cutting these sections from my angle irons, I weighed two of my 4"
beams
using my mothers postal scale, and the result was about three ounces.</font>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The window
holes in
my top hatch have not been fully cut out yet, but when they eventually
are, that will take 37 square inches from the total surface of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/All_Panels%282-1-2004%29.jpg">panels</a>.
In addition, two large holes will be cut out to accommodate CES's two <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hard_Drive_Coolers.jpg">80mm
case fans</a>; one on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a>, the other on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a>. Together, the two holes will take at least another
eight
square
inches off of my panels. This means the total surface area coming off
of
CES's chassis will be at least 45 square inches, which is a little more
than the surface area of one of my 6 x 7 aluminum top hatch doors (42
square
inches). So I weighed one of these hatch doors, and its weight was
around
three and a half ounces. This in addition of the weight saved from
cutting
the angle irons will be at least six and a half ounces, or about 0.4
pounds.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
There has
recently
been a change of plans about where I'm going to weigh the parts of CES.
Instead if going to the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.apsupermarket.com/" target="_top">A&amp;P</a></font><font size="-2">,
my parents suggested I instead go to the post office, and have the
parts
weighed there. The post office closes at four this afternoon, and it's
now
8:30AM and I haven't slept yet, so I better get some shut eye right
about
now. I'll be posting the results of the weigh in the next
paragraph.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
My mother and
I went
down to the local post office this afternoon, and the guy behind the
counter
was kind enough to weigh the parts of CES, which I had in the two
shoeboxes
and a plastic bag. The total weight turned out to be just over nine
pounds
and twelve ounces, which is just below my ten pound limit. If I take a
pound off of that to compensate for the packaging, the current official
weight of CES becomes eight pounds and twelve ounces, or about 8.75
lbs.
I reached this weight by factoring in the parts that I currently have
that
will be part of CES, and some of the heavier components that I will buy
in the future. The parts that I already have that I weighed are as
follows;
the angle irons, all chassis panels, the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">switches</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">LEDs</a>,
the top hatch hinges and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Concave_Brass_Knobs.jpg">knobs</a>,
both thin fans, both fan grills in their original packages, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Mount.jpg">one
of the fan mounts</a>. In order to compensate for the weight of
the
drives
I'm getting in the future, I weighed similar types of drives in their
place.
I plan on buying a laptop CD-ROM/floppy drive rack with the drives
included.
I guessed that the floppy drive plus the rack weighs about the same as
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy
drive</a> I was going to use in CES, so I included the old floppy
in
the
weighing. The slimline CD drive that comes with the rack is of similar
size and weight as <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">my
broken Thinkpad CD drive</a>, so I included the Thinkpad drive.
Finally,
since all IDE hard drives weigh about the same, I weighed <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive.jpg">my
broken Maxtor drive</a> in place of the 120GB drive I plan to buy
from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg</a>.</font>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Based on
CES's current
weight, the parts of the chassis I plan to chop out, and the components
I still have to get, I can come up with an estimate of how much CES
will
ultimately weigh. Once the chassis is chopped down to accommodate the
top
hatch hinges, fans, etc., at least six and a half ounces should be
taken
off of the computer's overall weight, bringing CES's weight down to 8
lbs,
5.5 ounces. A few days ago, I weighed a nut and bolt that are about the
size of the ones I plan to use for my top hatch hinges and latch, and
to
bolt the chassis together. The bolt and wash together weighed about a
tenth
of an ounce. There will be 46 nuts and bolt holding CES together; 24 on
the hinges, 2 on the latch, and 20 holding the angle irons and sheets
together.
If they all weigh about a tenth of an ounce, all the bolts should weigh
around five ounces total. This added to the 8 lb, 5.5 ounce computer
should
total 8 lbs, 10.5 ounces. If I can get a lightweight latch that weighs
under two ounces, that would mean a total of 8 lbs, 12.5 ounces.</font>

is 17 x 17cm, almost 49 square inches. I don't know how much it weighs,
but I found a way to get an estimate. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/3DFX_Voodoo_Card.jpg">One
of my Voodoo cards</a> is about 8 x 4 inches, or 32 square
inches. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Rockwell_Modem.jpg">A
really old dial-up modem</a> is 4 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches, or over 16
square
inches. Both cards have a total of about 49 square inches, just over
the
surface area of the motherboard. I once again used my mother's postal
scale
as I weighed each card, and was surprised at how heavy the cards were.
The Voodoo card was WAY off the scale, and I'm going to assume the card
weighs about five ounces. The tiny modem was a little bit lighter,
weighing
in at three and a half ounces. The two cards together weigh a total of
eight and a half ounces, bringing CES's total weight up to 9 lbs, 5
ounces.
The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Tri-Lighted_Video_Card_-_GPU_Cooler,_40mm_Fan.jpg">tri-lighted
case fan</a> is simply a replacement for the one already on the
motherboard,
so the fan does not effect the weight of the computer. The only items
left
to add to CES's weight are the 1GB RAM stick, the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Slim_ATAPI_to_Standard_ATAPI_Adapter.jpg" target="_top">CD
to IDE adapter</a>, the PW-60A
external power supply, and the Bart
Simpson
case badge. But since it is highly unlikely that these four items
together
will weigh any more than 11 ounces, it looks like CES will ultimately
stay
under the ten pound limit.</font> </p>
