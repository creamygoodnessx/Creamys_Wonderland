- Ever since
I
came up with the idea of putting flames on the sides of CES, I've
wondered exactly how I was going to do this. My first thought was to
buy a stencil, then use it to airbrush the flames on. But recently, I
thought it might be a good idea to make my own stencil by findind a
pixelated flame on the Internet, enlarging it in </font><font style="color: white; font-family: Press Start K;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1184951547051#versionTabview=tab1&amp;tabview=tab0" target="_top">Paint
Shop Pro</a></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">,
printing it out, cutting out the image's outline, and attaching it to
the side panel. I'd then airbrush over the stencil to get my effect.
It's 11:30 in the morning, and I just found the perfect image to use as
my flame stencil. It's the </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Green_Flames/Flame_Dev01.gif">big

I plan to edit it in PSP so that it looks like one continuous fire,
stretching all the way across the page. Since the gif is animated, I'll
try to use all of the frames, and paste each one next to each other in
order to reduce the monotony. Using the </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=contra3_owns" target="_top">Contra

1 street fire</a></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
as a guide, I will fill in the gaps at the bottom of the flames. Then
I'll change the color of the flames from orange to green. Once my
continuous fire image is complete, I'll print it out so the flames are
7" long and about 2 1/2" high. I will make three or four seperate
stencils, one for each color. I haven't figured how I'm going to
attatch the stencils to the panel, but I'll use one stencil at a time,
airbrushing on a different shade of green for each one. I think this is
going to be one of the funnest parts of the project. But of course I'll
have to learn how to airbrush; I've never done it before.</span><br style="font-family: Press Start K;">

yesterday, just before punching out, I asked the manager Sandy if she
just
happened to have a broken keyboard at home. To my surprise, she said
she
might just have one. So when I come back from work tonight, I may have
the means to start making my front panel. But I've been disappointed
before,
so I'll try not to get my hopes up too high. Speaking of work, I was
going
to take back the Felt Gard Plus furniture pads back to&nbsp;</font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home

yesterday, but forgot. Today, I'm
hoping my
memory will be a little better.<br>
<br>
&gt; OK, it's 6PM and I just
got back home from LFL after a record short hour and a half day of work.
Sandy didn't have a broken keyboard, but I did get a chance to return
the furniture pads to the Home Depot. It's nice to get my $4.21 back,
although I'm not sure if it will make that much of a difference in the
end.<br>

for my photo log again.<br>
<br>
&gt; I finished drawing what
is going to be me flame stencil. The LOZ flame has two frames of
animation; the second frame is just a mirror image of the first. I
saved a bmp copy of the gif, enlarged the 41 x 40 pixel canvas to 120 x 40 pixels,
changed the flame's color to green, and made four copies of the flame
in a row, so that the four flames overlapped each other slightly. The
second and fourth flames are reversed, so that the whole flame row
looks reversed in the middle. Right now, I can think of two ways I can
use this image to get the flames on my side panels. The first way is to
print the image on paper so it's just the right size, and somehow use
it as an airbrush stencil. The other way is to pencil in a grid that's
slightly smaller than 120 x 40 pixels directly on the panel, and then use
colored permanent markers to fill in the squares, using the flame image
as a guide.<br>

<font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">12/29/2003 - I've just
calculated how much CES's new chasis is going to weigh. The chasis is
going to be built on a 12" x 7" x 4" skeleton, made of a dozen 1/8"
thick aluminum angle iron beams. Four beams will be 12" long, four will
be 7" long, and the other four will be 4" long, totaling 92 linear
inches of beams. Because the angle iron I'm using weighs 0.28 lbs per
square foot, CES's skeleton will weigh approx. 2.156 lbs.<br>
<br>
&gt; The skeleton is going to
be covered with 1/16" thick aluminum panels on the sides (4" x 7"),
back (4" x 12"), and bottom (12" x 7"). The top will have a hinged
hatch consisting of two 6" x 7" aluminum panels with lexan windows. The
front panel will be made of lexan, plastic, or some metal from the
bottom plate of a discarded keyboard. Since it will be such a light
weight piece, and I don't know what it's going to be made of yet, I
will exclude the front panel from the chasis's overall weight until
further notice. All this comes out 272 square inches of aluminum,
assuming the top hatch is entirely aluminum without the lexan windows.
Because these aluminum sheets weigh about 0.9173 lbs per square foot,
CES's aluminum sheets will weigh around 1.743 lbs altogether.<br>
</span></font>

</center>
<font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">&gt; The 2.156 lb
skeleton
plus the 1.743 lb panels total a chasis that will weigh just under four
pounds, or 3.899 lbs to be more accurate. Most of the weight inside the
chasis will come from the system's three drives; The hard drive will
weigh about a pound, while the floppy drive and laptop CD drive will
probably have a combined weight one pound. The rest of the stuff in and
on CES ( the switches, PW 70, motherboard, wires, etc.), are so light,
they're not even worth factoring into the total weight. I've been
estimating the weight of the drives and chasis very conservatively, so
the weight of everything else should compensate for that. As a whole,
the Creamy Entertainment System will weigh about six pounds, which is
WAY less than the ten pound limit I set when I began the project. Joy.<br>

<font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">12/28/2003 - When I was
browsing <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/" target="_top">mini-itx.com</a> yesterday, I noticed that all the cases they sold
were a lot smaller than my proposed chasis of the Creamy Entertainment
System, which was to be 12" x 12" x 4". I thought about making the
chasis smaller, but at the time, I didn't think it was that much of a
big deal. Later that evening, when I opened the box for my new </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://us.playstation.com/ps2/" target="_top">Playstation
2</a></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
and took the console
out, I
measured the system at about
12" x 7" x 3". It was then when I realised that if I wanted to truly
give CES a console feel to it, I'll have no choice but to make it a lot
smaller than it already was. Eventually, I figured that 12" x 7" x 4"
would be a good new size for my system, providing I could work out how
to rearange the internal components should any complications arise with
the resize. It then occurred to me that my sliding hard drive rack
would no longer fit in the chasis, and I began to question if the
resize was a good idea. While I was lying awake in bed around 1AM this
morning, I realized that a single drive would fit perfectly under the
floppy drive. My main computer Candybox has three hard drive
partitions, but three partitions may not be needed in CES, since the
120GB drive would be plenty of space for it. Since I would have a total
archive of my files on Candybox once I buy the 200GB hard drive for it,
I would only have to store a portion of my movies on CES. So right
then, I decided to have only one
hard drive in CES. The computer's smaller size should make the chasis
more durable, and should cost less to build.<br>
<br>
&gt; I've been calculating
how much this project is going to cost today. I've already decided that
I'd stick to an $800 budget, and not spend any more than that. Here is
the initial list of items I planned to purchase before I took five
inches off the depth of my chasis yesterday...<br>

&gt; The smaller chasis means
that the only space left to put a hard drive is under the floppy drive,
a space that big enough for only one hard drive. This forces me to
forget the possibility of putting more drives in the system, which
means I no longer have a use for the IDE controller PCI card I was
planning to get. Taking this card out of the budget saves me an
additional $18.00<br>

&gt; I no longer plan to put

back to putting a pixelated green flame paint job on the panels.
Now, I plan on putting lexan windows on each of the top hatch doors,
and letting the illuminated fans shine through the top of the computer.
Speaking of lexan, I&#8217;ve just decided that paying a $25 handling charge
for a sub $10 piece of plastic is way too steep for my tastes, so I&#8217;m
going to forget about the lexan until I can get it cheaper somewhere
else. So the $30.91 piece of lexan out of the budget.<br>

&gt; I don&#8217;t know how well
the 4-port USB hub will fit into my chasis now that the front panel is
practically kissing the motherboard, so I&#8217;ll wait until I buy the board
and build the chasis&#8217;s skeleton before buying the hub. I plan to buy
three fans for CES&#8217;s interior. One will be a 80mm x 80mm x 25mm fan
that will go on the back panel behind the drives. The two other fans will be
a little smaller; one will be one for the CPU, and the other will be
for the external PW 70 power supply. Since I can put a fan of any size
on the back panel, but I&#8217;m not sure what fans fit on the PW 70 or the
motherboard, I will cut back on one of the two $5.50 fans I plan on
getting.<br>

&gt; I was just talking to JD
on the phone, and I asked him if he has any spare floppy drives I can
use for CES. He said he might, but he&#8217;ll have to look around first.
I&#8217;ve got a feeling he does have a spare, but until I&#8217;m sure, I will not
cut the floppy drive from the budget just yet.<br>

today while trying to find out what socket the VIA EIPA V8000 uses. I

The V10K is pretty much the same board as the V8K, except is has a 1GHz

all of
this stuff about cutting my costs, I just happened to get a peek at
bottom of my keyboard. When I did, it immediately occured to me that
the keyboard's bottom plate is a thin but sturdy metal, could be made
into a decent front panel for CES. I'll just have to hope I didn't
throw out all of my defective keyboards, because I could really use one
now. If I don't have any, I could also ask JD to see if he has any old
ones he plans to throw away.<br>

to
me a few days ago that the front of CES's skeleton would interfere with
the placement of some of the front panel's components, but today I
found a solution to this problem. I've decided that I'm going to
actually build some of the components on the skeleton, making it work
for me instead of against me. This morning, I worked out how to cut
holes in the skeleton just enough to accomidate the CD drive, the
floppy drive, and the LED lights. The </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset

appears
I won't have to drill a hole in that <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Arcade_Token.jpg">token</a>
after all. I found that the simple key ring I was
originally
going to use would work just fine as a contact point. The ring never
fit snugly around the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/White_LipStick_Cap.jpg">lipstick
cap</a>, but today I found a solution to this problem. I figured
that
if I could put
something
between the ring and the cap, I may be able to establish a tight fit. I
decided to use aluminum foil, because it wouldn't interfere with the
key
ring
when it bridged the gap between the two screws. The sheet of foil I
chose
was a good one; it had grease in it, making it highly expendable. I
used
a trimmer to slice off a narrow strip of the foil, wrapped the strip
around
the lower half of the cap, pushed the key ring over the foil, and
secured
it with a vertical piece of electrical tape. Then, it was time for the
final power test. I brought out <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
from the closet, plugged it in, removed the side panel, and plugged in
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_-_Bottom.jpg">bottom
of my custom power button</a> (the sawed-off medicine bottle) to
the
motherboard.
I bridged the two copper screws with a PCI card cover to make sure my
contacts
still worked. No problem there. Then, with my mother as my witness, I
put
the lipstick cap and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Copper_Spring.jpg">copper
spring</a> into the medicine bottle, and gave it a gentle push.
Polyfragger
came to life, and my switch passed its final test! In order to make the
ring stand up to a good push of the button, I reenforced it with some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glue</a> gel and a horizontal piece of electrical tape running
just
above
the key ring. When I found the foil itself could bridge the gap, I cut
off most of the foil below the key ring with my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-acto
knife</a>. All I need to do now to officially complete my power
switch
is to glue the top of the copper spring into the lipstick bottle, and
to
somehow permanently attatch the bottom of the spring to the bottom of
the
medicine bottle</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>

&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">I just had a
very
pleasant surprise from my dad, something that can almost be considered
an early Christmas present. He came to my bedroom, and handed me what
looked
to be a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_01.jpg">momentary
contact switch</a>, with two sturdy wires already in place. Now,
finishing
my reset button will only be a matter of stripping down <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Cable02.jpg">the
other half of my power switch cable</a>, tieing its two wires to
the
two
wires on the new switch, and testing the switch on Polyfragger. If the
switch passes the test, I will seal the gap with electrical tape. It's
only 3:20PM, so if I'm lucky, I might be able to finish both switches
by
Christmas</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">It's now
11:30PM,
and earlier tonight, I worked on my reset button, which was made from
the
switch my dad gave me this afternoon. I used my green <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Emrald_Swiss_Army_Knife.jpg">Swiss
Army Knife</a> to strip down the power switch cable, wrapped its
exposed
wires around the wires of the switch, and then tested the switch on
Polyfragger,
this time with my cousin Nick as my witness. The switch worked fine, so
I made the connection more permanent by <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">wrapping
the exposed wires with electrical tape</a>. Just for the hell of
it, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/RsB02_-_Test01.jpg">tested
the switch again</a>, and again it was able to turn on the
computer.
A little later on in the night, I finished my power button by Krazy
Gluing
the top of the copper spring to the inside of the lipstick cap, and
then
using my Krazy Glue / <a href="http://www.sculpey.com/" target="_top">Sculpey</a>
cocktail to glue the bottom of the spring to the base of the medicine
bottle.
Finally I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_-_Test.jpg">tested</a>
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">now
truly completed power button</a> on Polyfragger, and it was able
to
turn
on the computer most of the time. This has been an extraordinary day
for
my project, and I just hope neither of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">my

<font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">12/20/2003 - This is
another
day-late report. I was planning on taking a short nap and waking up at
8:30PM, but I went back to sleep and woke up mere minutes before
midnight, so I'm forced to log yesterday's progress late.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">I took the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Medicine_Bottle.jpg">medicine
bottle</a> to the garage and attempted to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Long_Hacksaw.jpg">hacksaw</a>
it down to 30mm. But when I tried to clamp it with the vice, the bottle
kept bending inward and falling out of the vice. In order to make the
bottle
more rigid, I put 14 quarters into it and closed the lid. I also marked
where I wanted the cut with a pen. Then, I put the bottle back on the
vice,
and sawed into it just enough to avoid damaging my hard earned change.
I took the quarters out, closed back the lid, and sawed the rest of the
way through. When I took the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Medicine_Bottle_-_Halves.jpg">sawed-down
bottle</a> back into the house, I realised that not only was the
sawing
terribly uneven, but it was 2mm too short as well. Fortunatey, this
didn't
appear to make too much of a difference in the switch's future
performance</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; After a short break, I
proceeded to make the holes for the screw contact points. I hammered a
sharp-pointed nail into the medicine bottle 18mm from the bottom, in
order to make it easier to drill a hole through that point. Dad lent me
his power drill, but I couldn't figure out how to change the drill
bits. After my dad showed me how to do this, I could then proceed. I
used the tiniest drill bit in the box to make a hole where I hammered
in the nail. Then, I used an increasingly larger bit, and tried to
screw in one of my contact points after every drilling. When I was
finally able to screw in the point snugly into the hole, I unscrewed it
and made a second hole a quarter way counter-clockwise around the
bottle, also 18mm from the bottom. I screwed a contact point into each
of the holes, and this did something I hadn't foreseen. The red wire
was wrapped around its contact point, and the point where the cable
split was pressed firmly against the contact point. Also, the white
wire was pressed tightly against the bottle, and its exposed wire was
partially pulled from under the duct tape that was holding it onto its
contact point. I'm not very good at explaining things, so here's a </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_-_Bottom.jpg">picture
of the wires</a></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
after I tightened the screws.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">At first, I
was worried
that pulling the wires tightly may have dislodged them from their
contact
points, but then I realised that this turn of events may actually be
advantageous,
since this would make the switch more compact and maybe less likely to
break. Of course, the switch would have to still be able to turn on a
computer
for this accidental design to work. I took the partially completed
switch
upstairs and ran its second power test on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>.
I hooked up the switch to the motherboard, and bridged the top of the
two
screws with a screwdriver. To my relief, the computer turned on, and
bridging
the screws again turned off the machine. I did this a few more times,
and
each time the switch worked. I then took the testing a step further by
bridging the bottom of the screws by sticking my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Arcade_Token.jpg">arcade
token</a> into the sawed-down medicine bottle. Again, the switch
turned
the computer on and off consistantly. Now that my power button has
passed
it's second power test, all I have to do now is make the switch's
bridge
by gluing a bored out arcade token to my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/White_LipStick_Cap.jpg">lipstick
cap</a>. As long as my two contact points are positioned at
exactly the
same height on the bottle, and as long as my wires don't snap like they
did on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_02.jpg">my
reset button</a>, I shouldn't have too much of a problem

light of my recent failure to get <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_02.jpg">my
reset button</a> to work, I managed to come up with a redesign of
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_-_Parts.jpg">my
power button</a>, which breathes new life into my custom switch
experiments.
Originally, I planned to have one contact point (key ring) on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/White_LipStick_Cap.jpg">lipstick
cap</a> come down to meet the second contact point (copper ring)
on top
of the medicine bottle. My new design is similiar to the old one,
except
instead of a single contact point resting on top of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Medicine_Bottle.jpg">medicine
bottle</a>, there will now be two tiny screws screwed in the
middle of
the bottle on either side, each will have its own power switch wire
taped
to it (forget about that soldering crap). A bored out <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Arcade_Token.jpg">arcade
token</a> will be glued onto the lipstick cap, and will bridge
the two
screws to turn the computer on and off</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">As far as the
building
of the power button goes, I will first find two tiny screws, preferably
copper or brass. I will then temporarily attach my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Custom_Power_Cable.jpg">motherboard
power cable</a> to the screws, attach the cable to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>,
and see if bridging the two screws with the arcade token will turn the
computer. If the switch passes this first test, I will saw the medicine
bottle down to 30 millimeter high, detach the wires from the screws,
screw
them into the bottle at opposite ends, making sure not to get them too
far in, since this could interfere with the movement of the
cap. The two screws would also have to be mounted at exactly the same height
in order for the token to touch them both at the same time. I'll then
run
a second test on Polyfragger to see if the switch can still turn on the
computer. If the switch passes the second test, the next step will be
to
bore a hole in the arcade token, using the same method my dad did on
the
pennies. If I can make the hole just the right size, it should fit
tightly
around the lipstick cap. After this will be the all important final
test
to see if the switch still turns on my computer. If the switch passes
this
test, I will glue the copper spring permanently into place. It's only
9AM,
so I think I'll be able to finish my power button by the end of the day</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>

tiny <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PC_Screws.jpg">PC
screws</a> for my contact points, but I found that the power
switch
wires
were easier to wrap around screws that were a bit longer. I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Electrical_Tape.jpg">electrical
tape</a> to tightly hold the wires to the screws, and I don't
plan to
undo
them unless it becomes absolutely necessary to do so. The power switch
cable wasn't stripped down far enough for me to connect the screws to
opposite
sides of the medicine bottle, so I decided to settle for putting the
screws
a quarter of the way around the bottle from each other. After two or
three
attempts, I managed to connect my contact points to the wires so that
they
consistantly turned on/off Polyfragger. By the way, while I was running
the tests, I noticed that my power switch cable was a lot thinner than
the motherboard cables already in the machine. Maybe if I'd gotten a
thicker
cable, it wouldn't keep falling apart every time I altered it</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>

<font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">12/17/2003 - </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">There's
a whole lot going on today, and it's only 4:30PM. Normally, I wait
until
the end of the day to write my daily report, but today's events are
zipping
by so fast, I'm already forgetting all that's happening, so forgive me
if I leave out anything. This morning, my dad and I were working on
getting
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_01.jpg">reset
button</a> working. He clamped a long, grey plastic strip to the
kitchen
table. He took a penny, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glued</a> it onto the strip, put a nail on what he thought was
the
center
of the penny, and hit it a few times with a hammer. This made a small
dent
in the penny, which he then slowly widened with an electric drill.
Starting
out with the smallest drill bit, he drilled into the penny with
increasingly
wider bits until he reached the biggest one. The hole was way off
center,
but it didn't matter too much, and it was just the right size to be
used
as my reset button's top contact point. My dad used the same process
for
the bottom washer, but because he'd already used his biggest drill bit
for the top contact point, he had to file the second penny's hole wider
for it to be used as the bottom contact point. He then brought in a
blowtorch,
and blasted the bottom contact point for a few seconds. The idea was to
melt the penny just enough to attach one of my power switch wires to
it.
However, things didn't go exactly as planned. The flame ended up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Melted_Penny.jpg">melting
the penny</a>, making it useless as a contact point. My dad made
another
penny botttom contact point using the same drilling and filing method,
but this time, he got the hole pretty much dead center</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">The next
phase was
to attach the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/R&amp;W_Wires.jpg">power
switch wires</a> to the penny contact points. Using a soldering
gun
with
a worn out tip, we managed to solder the wires to the pennies. My dad
soldered
while I held the clamp to keep the pennies still. Amazingly <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Penny_Rings.jpg">the
solder held</a>, and I was confident that my reset button was
nearing
completion.
However, my dad had trouble Krazy Gluing the penny contact points to
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Soap_Pump.jpg">soap
pump</a>; the pennies just wouldn't stick to the pump's plastic.
Then
it
was my turn to give the gluing a try. With the Krazy Glue and a bit of <a href="http://www.sculpey.com/" target="_top">Sculpey</a>,
I got the two pennies to stay in place. But before I could test my now
completed reset button, the top wire snapped off. As I was
showing
my dad what happened, the other wire came off as well. In desperation,
I decided to forget about the solder and just Krazy Glue the wires on,
losing about an inch on one of my wires as I accidentily cut two short
lengths off it trying to strip it down. When I hooked up my button to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>'s
motherboard and tried it out, the computer wouldn't turn on. However, I
was able to turn the machine on by manually bridging the wires with
some
long and sharp metal object</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; Needless to say, today
was a major setback, but I'm not about to give up on my custom reset
button. There are a few more things I want to try before I'll consider
quitting, including using the original steel washers, taping them into
place instead of using solder. This day wasn't a total loss, though. As
suddenly as my </span><a style="font-family: Press Start K;" href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">Veo
digital camera</a><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
apparantly broke itself, it
magically
came back to life when I plugged it back in and turned it on. As for
everything that's gone wrong today, I have a feeling this won't be the
only snag in my quest to create my own gaming rig. It's 11:30PM now,
and I think I've earned my rest for tonight.<br>

I
was waiting for my ride to the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> after I got off work, I made another <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_-_Angle01.jpg" target="_top">sketch
of the Creamy Entertainment System</a>, redesigning it yet again.
Because
so much of the left side of the chasis (right side from the front,) was
being taken up by the lexan window, I wouldn't have a lot of room to
paint
on the pixelated flames I'd wanted. Instead I am now putting a glowing
green lightstick around the window's parimeter on the inside of the
lexan,
and changing the paint job as well. On the bottom of the panel will be
the words "Creamy Entertainment System", unbroken and in all caps, and
in the <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=alttp" target="_top">LOZ:
A Link to the Past</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=fonts" target="_top">font</a>.
The word "Entertainment" will be a different color from the other two
words.
As for the front panel, I have decided to mount the laptop CD drive in
an actual laptop CD drive bay, instead of trying to fit into a standard
IDE CD drive bay. By sacrificing compatability with IDE CD drives, I
will
now have more room to use two soda bottle caps for the mounts of my
PS/2
ports. I figure not being able to use an IDE CD drive won't be that
much
of a big deal, since I won't be changing my <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/store/default.asp?c=5#p281" target="_top">DVD/CDRW</a>
for a long-ass time, and because an IDE CD drive would add unwanted
weight
to CES anyway. Instead of aluminum, I'm now going to make the front
panel
out of lexan, so I can mount lightsticks behind the panel. The
lightsticks
will divide the panel into four sections; power buttons and lights, USB
ports, PS/2 ports, and drives</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">After my dad
and I
left my job at <a href="http://www.ladyfootlocker.com/" target="_top">LFL</a>,
we headed straight to the Home Depot so I could look for some copper or
brass washers I was planning on using as the contact points for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_-_Parts.jpg">power</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_01.jpg">reset</a>
buttons. We couldn't find any such washers, but that didn't stop me
from
browsing anyway. I found some angle irons, but decided not to buy them
since I had found some much stronger aluminum angle irons on <a href="http://www.OnlineMetals.com" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a>.
I was also drawn to some sliding keyboard drawer mounts. I plan to use
four of these mounts to make it easy to push in and pull out my hard
drive
rack mount. The ones I need have to be three to four inches long, but
the
shortest I could find were twelve inches long. No good :(. However, I
did
see something I could use. I found a set of padded furniture legs for
use
for the bottom panel of my chasis. Right after I bought the set for
$4.21,
it dawned on me that I could have just found some at home and not have
had to spend a penny. Oh well, that'll teach me not to be so damn
impulsive</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.<br>
<br>
</span></font>
<div style="text-align: center; font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><font size="-2">$7.00 + $4.21 = $11.21 spent so far<br>

&gt; </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">After I got
back home
from the Hope Depot at around 5:30PM, I was putting my change in my
four
plastic change tubes when something hit me from out of the blue. I
realised
that the pennies I was putting away were made of copper, and could make
good contact points for my reset button if I drilled the right sized
holes
in them. In order for this to work, I'll have to drill the hole for the
top penny PRECISELY the right size to fit the bottom tier of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Soap_Pump.jpg">soap
pump</a>. If the hole is even a millimeter off, the penny will
drop to
the bottom of the actuating part of the pump, and will be useless. <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
has a drill that can drill through a penny, and if I ask him really
nicely,
maybe he'll let me use it this weekend</font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">.&nbsp;</span></font>
