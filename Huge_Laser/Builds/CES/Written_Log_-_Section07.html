The Quad-Lighted
40mm Fan I want to buy from <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron</a>
to replace the fan of my future <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">Mini-ITX
motherboard</a> is still sold out and still no ETA has been
announced.
If the fan isn't available for ordering by the time I do my ordering
spree
at Directron, I will forget about the fan and take it off of my budget.
It's possible I'll get the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Tri-Lighted_Video_Card_-_GPU_Cooler,_40mm_Fan.jpg">Tri-Lighted
Video Card Cooler</a> if it's still available then, but only if
the
price
doesn't go up from $9.99. But for now, despite my better judgment, I'll
leave my budget as it is in the hopes that the quad-lighted fan will
arrive
on time to be included in my ordering spree.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Over the past
two
days, it's occurred to me that thumbscrews would probably not be the
best
option for keeping my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a> closed. The hatch doors themselves will be 3/16" thick,
and
will
rest on top of a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">1/8"
top angle iron</a>, meaning for thumbscrews to be effective,
they'd
have
to be half an inch long. I think it would be better to take advantage
of
my hatch method of internal access by considering the use of a latch
that
would be fixed to the inner edge of one of the hatch doors. In the
latch's
open position, it would lie parallel to the inner edge, and rest
completely
on the doors it's fastened to. I could close the latch by giving it a
quarter
turn, so that it covers the opposite door. I could buy one for each
door,
and put them on opposite ends of the inner edge, so that each door can
hold the other closed. The next time I go to the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a>, I'll try to find the lightest latch possible, in order
to
keep
the weight down on my computer.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's about a
quarter-past
1PM, and I'm having some serious concerns about the top hatch of CES.
If
I decide to use a pair of latches to hold the hatch closed instead of
thumbscrews,
there's an issue of space I'll have to deal with. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Brass_Handles.jpg">brass
handles</a> are about 3 1/2" long, and will be mounted in the
middle of
the inner edge of the seven inch-deep hatch doors. Therefore, the only
place left for me to mount my latches is the 1" x 3/4" space between
the
handles and where the top angle irons end. The latches will have to be
less than two inches long, so they don't cover the top hatch windows in
their closed position. I can't use sliding latches, because the only
place
of the doors where they won't pass over the windows is on the edges,
and
if I mount them there, the bolts holding the latches in place will run
into the top angle irons, and may prevent the doors from fully closing.
If I find that sliding bolts are my only option, I may have to drill
holes
in the top beams in order to accommodate the latches' bolts.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/23/2004 - This
afternoon,
my parents and I stopped at a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> down here in south Florida. I came to an aisle that
included
an assortment of handles and doorknobs. After carefully considering my
choices, I eventually settled on two <a href="http://www.libertyhardware.com/" target="_top">Liberty
Hardware</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Brass_Handles.jpg">brass
handles</a>, which are of a squarish U-shaped design, and around
three
inches long. Each one comes with a pair of bolts, and I think I can use
them to attach the handles to my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a>. The handles cost $2.19 each, so the total cost
would
normally
be $4.38. However, since my parents bought them along with a few of
their
own purchases, I'm going to give them back $5.00 for the hinges.</font>
</p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$654.48
total
budget + $5.00 for 2 brass handles = $659.48 total budget</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Another thing
I bought
at the Home Depot was a package of two <a href="http://professional.iveshardware.com/" target="_top">Ives</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg"><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg">brass </a></font></a><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg">broad
hinges</a>, which are way lighter than the dresser hinges I
was
originally
going to use. Each hinge is two inches long, with three holes on each
surface,
totaling six holes a hinge. Since I have five inches of space on each
hatch
door, two of these hinges can easily fit on each door. If I get a
chance,
I will go back to the Home Depot to get another pair of the same
hinges.
I don't think I can use the screws that came with the hinges, since
they
appear to be designed to mount the hinges on a wooden surface. However,
on my next visit to the Depot, I can get a set of the right nuts and
bolts
as well. But for now, I will only consider the cost of this one pair of
hinges, which was $2.97. Once again rounding to the higher dollar, I'll
give my parents $3.00 for the hinges.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Unfortunately, I couldn't
find the thumbscrews I need for my top hatch. If I can't find a set of
half inch-long thumbscrews by the time I get back to Jersey, I'll see
if
I can assemble some myself with the screws in the garage.</font> </p>

night,
my dad set up and plugged in a new desk lamp in my room. As he was
taking
the parts out of the box, I noticed a red plastic cap was covering the
two prongs of the outlet plug. It was the same kind of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">red
cap</a> that came with the floor lamp Jimmy and Sherri gave me

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/16/2004 - Early
this
morning, I decided to find out if ordering multiple items in a single
order
would save me money on shipping and handling. I have at least eight
more
items to order, and the S&amp;H will probably average seven bucks
each.
If I bought them individually and paid the S&amp;H on each one, it
would
amount to around $60 total for just S&amp;H. So I went to <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>,
and added to the shopping cart three of the four items I plan to
order
from there; the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">EPIA
V10000A motherboard</a>, the </font><font size="-2">green
EL cable</font><font size="-2">, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Samsung_Slim_Combo_Drive_8x_DVD-Rom.jpg">Samsung
CDRW/DVD drive</a>. I left out the 4 LED case fan, because it's
still
sold
out. The total came out to be just over a hundred dollars, and I only
had
to pay the S&amp;H once. This meant that if I order all three items
at
once, I will end up paying the S&amp;H charge two times less than
if I
order them individually.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; While
previewing the
orders on Directron, I found out the EPIA V10000A motherboard I'm
getting
has dropped in price from $109.00 to $99.99. This is obviously great
news,
since it means that I'll be saving $9.01 on my budget.</font> </p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$656.26 total
budget
- $9.01 less spent = $647.25 total budget.</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just
searched Directron
for another Slimline CD to IDE adapter, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Slim_ATAPI_to_Standard_ATAPI_Adapter.jpg">found
one</a> for $9.99. This is four cents more than <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Slimline_CD_to_40-pin_IDE_Adapter.jpg">the
one I was planning on getting</a> at <a href="http://www.logicsupply.com" target="_top">Logic
Supply</a>, but because this is one less time I'll have to pay a
shipping
and handling charge, this decision will end up saving me money.</font>
</p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$647.25 total
budget
+ $0.04 more spent = $647.29 total budget.</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Right now, I
plan
on ordering four items at Directron; the adapter, the motherboard, the
EL cable, and the DVD drive. This will push my order above $200, and
normally
this would be my spending cap, but because I'm buying four items with a
single S&amp;H charge, I'll make an exception. I found that if I
make
an
order of at least $100 on Directron, I can get a case badge that would
normally cost $3.99 for only a penny. You can either pick from a wide
selection
of badges, or you can customize your own. I'm going to design my own
badge,
and I already have something in mind. It will be a faded picture of me
with my personal insignia overlaid on top of it.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Apparently, I
was
confused as to how the one cent badges work. I can only order the
custom
badges in sets of 100, not individually. So I think I'll pick the Bart
Simpson badge they're offering, at least until I see something I like
better.</font> </p>
<center style="font-family: Press Start K; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
<p><font size="-2">$647.29 total
budget
+ $0.01 for Bart Simpson Case Badge = $647.30 total budget.</font></p>
</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I took my
order to
Directron's Billing Information page to see how much S&amp;H I'll
have
to pay for the items I'm getting. However, I'm not going any further,
because
I want to wait until I get a temporary job down here in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>
to establish a positive cash flow before parting with so much money. <a href="http://www.ups.com" target="_top">UPS</a>
Ground Residential seems to be the cheapest method of shipping
Directron orders, and it's only $7.18. This will probably be the only time in this
project
when I list the price of shipping by itself in my budget.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/15/2004 - It
appears
that I do have something to report about the Creamy Entertainment
System
after all. I may not have access to CES's chassis while visiting <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>,
but I can still shop online, and buy certain components for the
machine.
I can also do a bit of redesigning, at least up to a point. Three days ago while
eating Pizza at <a href="http://www.sbarro.com/" target="_top">Sbarro's</a>
in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aventuramall.com/" target="_top">Aventura Mall</a>, I&nbsp;redesigned the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a>. I'm going to need many things in order to
complete
the hatch, and will probably buy them at the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> the next time I get a chance. The hatch doors will be
attached
to the rest of the chassis by a pair of lightweight piano hinges, one
on
the outer side of each door. The hinges will have to be five inches
long,
because the doors are seven inches wide, and 5" hinges would allow just
enough clearance for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">1"
wide angle irons</a> on either side of the hinge. A currently
unknown
number
of small bolts will hold each hinge in place. Each hatch door will be
locked
in place by two thumbscrews, one on either end of the inner side of
each
door. A five inch-long handle will be bolted onto each door, and will
lie
between the thumbscrews. The lexan panel of each hatch door will be
bolted
to the bottom of its aluminum counterpart with the same bolts that hold
the handle and hinges to the door. The bolts will have to be half an
inch
long, in order to pass through both panels of each hatch door, and
still
have room to accommodate a nut. (The aluminum sheets are 1/16" thick,
and
the lexan sheets are 1/8" thick, totaling 3/16" of thickness) The
thumbscrews
will also be a half-inch long, so they too can pass though both the
aluminum
and lexan sheets of each door, plus the 1/8" top angle irons.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Over the past
two
days, I've been once again searching the Web for cheaper components for
my low budget build, and managed to find a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Samsung_Slim_Combo_Drive_8x_DVD-Rom.jpg">slimline
CD-RW/DVD drive</a> from <a href="http://www.samsung.com/" target="_top">Samsung</a>
at <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>.
I'll save a bunch of money on this purchase, because I'll be paying
only
$81.99, and this includes an audio cable. This means I don't have to
pay
$115.99 for the same type of drive from <a href="http://www.sony.com/" target="_top">Sony</a>,
plus two bucks extra for an audio cable.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; More Web
surfing made
me realize that the prices and availability of RAM and hard drives vary
constantly. A stick of RAM could be less than $100 one day, and a month
later it costs more than $120. Items which are available one day can be
sold out the next. The two-pack of RAM I was going to get for $180 now
costs $210. So I'll have to look for cheaper alternatives. I'm looking
for any PC133 SDRAM DIMM stick that I can get for less than $90. I have
a policy that I never spend any more than $200 on any single purchase,
so I'll have to consider taxes and S&amp;H to make sure I stay
under
this
limit. Because my RAM purchase will cost close to $200, I'll have to
take
ALL costs into consideration. For now, I'll leave the RAM in the budget
unchanged. The 120GB 7200RPM Maxtor hard drive I was going to get at <a href="http://www.newegg.com" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>
for $90 was sold out for a while, but it's once again available, this
time
for $88.25.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/9/2004 - I am
typing
out this log entry from <a href="http://www.newarkairport.com/aviation/ewrhomemain.htm" target="_top">Newark
Airport</a>. I'm sitting in the terminal, waiting for my flight
to St.
Petersburg Florida, and my flight is running late. I have nothing to
report
about the Creamy Entertainment System today. In fact, I won't have
anything
to report on it for the next few months. My parents' condo home in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>
is in an apartment building, and it wouldn't be practical to be
hammering
and sawing with neighbors above and below me, so I won't be taking my
chassis
down with me. Besides, I didn't want to take a chance of losing it at
the
airport. So unless I buy something relevant to my project, you won't be
hearing any reports from me for a while. However, I'll be seeking new
employment
during my vacation, so I'll be able to make a little extra money to pay
for my project's remaining components, and to pay my parents back for
the
very laptop (<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>)
I'm using to type this. So I guess this is the last you'll be hearing about this project for a while.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/7/2004 - I went
over
to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house again
today, this time to use his <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Soldering_Iron.jpg">soldering
iron</a> to change the LED in my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/FlD_-_Faceless01.jpg">floppy
drive</a>, and to change the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires02.jpg">switches</a>
on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">cold
cathode grills</a>. I was originally going to go tomorrow, but
decided
to go today so I could spend all day Sunday preparing for my Florida
vacation
when I visit my parents in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>.
I had to use JD's soldering iron because my dad's soldering gun didn't
work. As it turns out, this happened to be a blessing in disguise for
two
reasons. First, the kind of solder I was going to use was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Plumbing_Solder.jpg">plumbing
solder</a>, which would have been way too thick to use on my
drives.
Second,
the soldering gun was probably way too powerful for the transplant, and
could have melted the floppy drive's circuit board, which would have
obviously
been no good.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The first
thing JD
and I did was the LED transplant; taking the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Square_LED01.jpg">yellow
LED</a> out of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_CD_Drive.jpg">busted
CD drive</a> and replacing my floppy drive's green LED with it.
So I
opened
up my CD drive again, and only <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Bottomless.jpg">took
off the bottom cover</a>. I was going to go further, but JD
suggested
that
I didn't need to completely expose the LED, and that the solder could
be
melted from the opposite side of the circuit board. After the initial
heating
of the soldering iron, JD used the iron to melt the LED's solder, and
the
LED came out surprisingly easily. Working with the floppy drive proved
to be a bit more of a hassle. I opened up the floppy drive, and only
needed
to take off the bottom cover. Like the CD drive, JD melted off the
LED's
solder from the back of the circuit board.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The next step
would
have been to put the CD drive's old yellow LED into the floppy drive
where
its green one used to be, however I wanted to test to see not only if
the
yellow LED worked at all, but also to see if it truly was yellow. So JD
got out his multimeter and ran a series of tests to see if the LED
worked,
without success. I thought the the LED was broken, and asked him to
test
the green one the he took out of the old drive. When he did, he got the
same result. So he taped two AA batteries together with electrical
tape,
attached two wires of an antenna cord to the ends of the batteries, and
the other end of the cord to the LED. When he tested the LED this time,
it lit up yellow, and very brightly too. JD also tested the green LED
just
for the hell of it, and it too worked just fine.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Once testing
was was
done, we were ready to put the yellow LED into the floppy drive.
However,
just when JD was about to put the LED in place, I asked him if he knew
which way the LED was supposed to go. He didn't know yet, so he ran a
test
to find out. First, he needed to know which end of the LED was
positive.
He used the batteries to light the LED again, but this time he took
note
of which end was leading to the batteries' negative terminals. It
turned
out to be the the side which a grove within the LED was pointing
towards,
or the side of the internal metal plate that was thinner than the other
side. Next, JD needed to find out which way the positive pin of the LED
was to be mounted. I don't remember exactly how he did this, but it had
something to do with the way the pins on the floppy drive's old LED
were
bent.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Once the
yellow LED's
correct direction was determined, JD was ready to insert it where the
floppy's
old LED used to be. He bent the LED's pins to fit into two pin holes he
drilled with a pindrill earlier. He snaked the LED through the arch in
the floppy's frame, and pushed it into place from under the circuit
board.
Then, he soldered the new LED into place, being careful not to let to
two
solder points touch. JD was able to test if the LED still worked by
putting
the batteries to it again, and again it lit up. The LED stuck so far
out
beyond the arch, that we doubted that it would fit behind the drive's
face
plate. We considered taking the LED window off the plate, so that the
LED
could fit through it. However, when we put the faceplate on the drive,
the LED surprisingly still fit behind it just fine!</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; We moved on
to task
of changing the on/off switch on my cold cathode grills. JD used the
multimeter
to test if the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/New_CCG_Switches.jpg">switches</a>
worked, and both switches passed the test. He unscrewed the switch from
one of the grill's faceplates, cut it's two wires with a wire cutter,
stripped
off the ends, then twisted them tightly. He then tinned the wires with
the soldering iron and a bit of solder. In order to tin the contact
points
on switches, he needed to switch to the iron's higher setting, and use
slightly thicker solder. When he cut off the excess length of wire, that <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires03.jpg">completed
the first switch</a>. I took over for doing the second switch, with
a
little
supervision of course. I did have a bit of a shaky start, but
eventually
I got the hang of soldering. This was a rather difficult soldering job,
because the contacts were so thick, but I think I still did an OK job
for
a beginner.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Unfortunately, I ran
down the battery of <a href="http://users.skynet.be/inforad/coolpix_macropfhoto.htm" target="_top">the
camera</a>, and JD apparently didn't have a spare. There wasn't
time to
recharge the battery to take the soldering photos, so I don't have any
pictures of the build. I obviously can't take pictures of anything
irreversible
we did, so I'm sorry to say that I've missed out on a lot of important
shots. Oh well, that's just the way things go sometimes. :( On a
positive
note, JD did give me a pair of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/JD%27s_Hinges.jpg">small,
2" long hinges</a> I might be able to use for my top hatch. It's
almost
11:30PM, and I'm eagerly waiting for myself to finish this part of the
log so I can test out my modified equipment. I don't think I'm going to
have any problems, but a lot of crazy things have happened with this
project
already, so I wouldn't rule out that possibility just yet.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just tested
the
floppy drive and one of the cold cathode grills. I hooked up the floppy
drive to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>,
but I never saw the light come on, even after I put a disk into it.
Thinking
I may have somehow broken the drive, I disconnected it and plugged it
into <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a>.
The drive worked without any problems, and the yellow light came on OK.
Then, I re-assembled one of my grills and plugged it into one of
Polyfragger's
female Molex connectors. I turned on the computer, and when I flipped
the
grill's new switch, the grill glowed its bright green color. So
everything
basically came out OK today.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/6/2004 - A few
minutes
before midnight, I began the task of chopping down my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
CD drive</a>. My goal was to remove the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Square_LED01.jpg">LED</a>
without damaging it. Its pins were soldered onto the circuit board, and
the drive's bottom cover was on top of the circuit board, sitting one
or
two millimeters away from the LED, so I couldn't just pull it out.
Using
the two screwdrivers in my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Toolkit.jpg">PC
repair toolkit</a>, I took the CD drive apart piece by piece. I
began
by
unscrewing the four screws at the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Bottom.jpg">bottom
of the drive</a>. This allowed me to take the bottom cover off of
the
drive,
exposing not one, but <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Bottomless.jpg">two
circuit boards</a>. The large circuit board at the back had
several
screws
on it. The other board was narrow and was roughly the shape of a stick
of RAM, and was held down by only one screw. I took out all of the
screws
from the both boards, and only then did I realize that I only needed to
unscrew to narrow board. Taking out the single screw on the narrow
circuit
board wasn't enough to dislodge it, and soon I found out why. There
were
two more screws, each on one of the upper corners, and I soon realized
that these screws were inserted from the other side. This meant that
taking
off the narrow board and ultimately getting to the LED would mean
getting
to the other side of those screws. Eventually, I figured that the next
step would be to take off the CD drive's top cover, which was held on
by
three shallow screws; one one the CD's left side, one on the right, and
the other at the back. Once they were gone, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Topless.jpg">top
cover taken off</a>, I could see the other side of the two screws
I
needed
to undo. After I unscrewed those, I only needed to bend the sides of
the
drive outward a little bit to wiggle the narrow circuit board <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Thin_Board.jpg">out
of place</a>. Now, the only thing holding the board in place was
a thin
ribbon cable. While I was dissecting the CD drive, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Broken_Tabs.jpg">three
of the tabs</a> I had broken while taking off its faceplate fell
out of
the drive.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The yellow
LED had
two prongs, which went through two tiny holes in the circuit board, and
held on by a bit of solder. The prongs were bent forward at a 90 degree
angle, so I bent them <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Square_LED03.jpg">straight
upwards</a> to get a better idea of how to take them out. I
remembered
that on the web
page on www.ochw.com I
was reading only a few hours ago, the man who was changing the LED of
his
floppy drive had taken out his old LED by unsoldering it. He said he
put
the soldering iron to the old LED, and heated it just long enough to
melt
the solder, so he could remove the LED without damaging the drive. I
went
back upstairs to Candybox to take another look at the page, just to make
sure
I wasn't missing anything too important. I then headed to the garage to
look for my dad's soldering gun. I checked a blue metal case, and while
I didn't find the soldering gun, I did find Dad's Dremmel, something
that
he'd been unable to find for months. I learned how to use such a tool
last
weekend while I was cutting out one of CES's <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch windows</a> last weekend at <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house, so I can use this Dremmel for various parts of my project when
I'm
not visiting JD. I also found <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/New_CCG_Switches.jpg">two
constant contact switches</a> which will be great replacements
for <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires02.jpg">the
ones</a> on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">cold
cathode grills</a>. I found the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Plumbing_Solder.jpg">solder</a>,
but after searching the garage fairly thoroughly, I couldn't find the
soldering
gun.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's seven
PM, and
I'm about to unsolder the CD drive's yellow LED. I've got my
workstation
set up in the kitchen, and I've found the soldering gun, because when I
called my dad in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>,
he told me where to find it. Unfortunately, JD and Jen's <a href="http://users.skynet.be/inforad/coolpix_macropfhoto.htm" target="_top">Nikon
digital camera</a> ran out of batteries while I was taking
pictures
today.
So unfortunately, there will be a photo log blackout for this soldering
job. Because I will be doing a lot of irreversible work today, I will
be
missing out on a lot of potential pictures. Oh well, maybe I can
re-enact
this transplant someday, just for the photos.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It turns out
that
the camera has power after all. Unfortunately, it won't last too long,
so I'll have to do everything I can to conserve power. There are three
ways I will deal with this problem. First, I will take shots only when
I'm about to do something irreversible, and take everything else when I
have the power. Second, I will only take one picture per item. I'll
need
to anyway, since I only have about six shots left. Third, I will try to
leave the camera on at twenty second intervals, and no longer. The camera's
reliability will certainly help here.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I plugged in
the soldering
gun and tried to melt off the solder that was holding the CD drive's
LED
into place. However, the solder showed no signs of melting. I thought
the
tip of the gun might have been rusted, so I grabbed a cylindrical file
from the garage, and filed some of the rust off. After two hours of
unsuccessfully
trying to melt the LED's solder in my attempt to dislodge it, I finally
gave up. I then tried melting some of the solder just to see what would
happen, but it didn't even get warm. So I think it's a safe bet that
the
gun is busted, and that I won't be using it again. It looks like I'll
be
doing this at JD's place this weekend when I try it with his <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Soldering_Iron.jpg">soldering
iron</a>. I didn't need the camera, since I had no progress to
photograph.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; With nothing
better
to do, I took apart my floppy drive, just to make the process easier
when
I finally do it at JD's place this weekend. My goal was to access the
LED
and examine it. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/FlD_-_Faceless01.jpg">face
plate was already off</a>, so that was one step already out of
the way.
I only needed to remove two screws to take off the bottom cover to get
a better view of the LED, which turned out to be 3mm, and fastened to
the
underside of the circuit board. In order to see what was under the LED,
I removed the only screw on the circuit board, which loosened it.
Wiggling
the board from under two hooks in the front that were holding it in
place
loosened the board further. The tip of the LED stuck through some kind
of arc-shaped hole in the frame, holding that part of the board down,
so
I had to bend the LED down in order to get it free. There were three
more
hooks at the back, which were holding that part of the circuit board in
place, but I decided to leave those alone in fear of snapping one of
the
four thin copper wires that attached the board to the rest of the drive.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/5/2004 - It
would seem that a trip to the hardware store is pretty much in order.
There
are a whole bunch of things I'd like to buy for CES. When I was at&nbsp;</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font><font size="-2">'s
house last weekend, I asked him about what kind of finishing coating I
could put on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Side_Panels01.jpg">side
panels</a> to keep the permanent marker flames from rubbing off.
He
said
that something called lacquer would be ideal, so I'm going to see if I
can find some of that. Another suggestion JD
gave me was to replace&nbsp;the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dresser_Hinges01.jpg">dresser
hinges</a> I may use for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a>. The hinges altogether weigh a hefty 11 ounces, but JD
suggested
that instead of two of the hinges on each door, I could put one long
piano
hinge on each door. This would cut down on the weight and be equally as
effective, plus I wouldn't have to cut down the ends of the hinges to
make
them fit. So the next time I visit a hardware store, I'll see if I can
get two gold five inch long piano hinges. The third thing I'd like to
buy
is a set of nice looking thumbscrews, because I couldn't find a match
for
any of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Salvaged_Thumbscrews.jpg">three
I found last weekend</a>. I now plan to mount two thumbscrews to
either
end of the inner sides of each top hatch door, and put a five inch long
handle on each hatch door between the thumbscrews. Fourth, I'd like to
buy myself eight thin, 35mm long, bolts to hold my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Packages.jpg">fans</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">grills</a>
into place. I'll probably need a whole bunch of additional nuts and
bolts
to hold the chassis together.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; There are a
couple
changes I'd like to make to CES's hardware, although some of it may be out
of my league. The CD drive I plan to order in the late phases of my
project
will most likely have a yellow LED. In order to keep the color scheme
consistent
in my front panel, I would like to try to replace the green LED in my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy
drive</a> with a yellow one. When I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/FlD_-_Faceless01.jpg">took
the faceplate off</a> of the floppy drive I plan to use in CES, I saw that the drive had a small green LED. I called JD for advice,
and he said that a mistake in the replacement could severely damage the
drive. I would have practiced this procedure on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Floppy_Drive.jpg">broken
floppy</a>, but it uses a different kind of LED from my newer
drive. So
just now, I decided to search online for a floppy drive that uses a
yellow
LED. Unsuccessful, I tried searching for one with a blue LED. I came
across
a page
on www.ochw.com
that featured an article about someone who did exactly what I'm
considering
doing; he replaced an LED in his floppy drive with a bigger blue one.
Since
I learned how to solder from JD nearly three weeks ago, I think I'm
almost
ready to try something like this. However, I still need something
expendable
to practice on. Since my broken floppy drive is no good for this, I
think
that I might be able to practice on a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
CD drive</a>. If I fuck that up, I always have my unused but
still
working <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Tape_Drive.jpg">tape
drive</a> to fall back on.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The other
thing I
wanted to change is the on/off switch on my cold cathode grills. The
tiny
red switch on faceplates may be a bit too small for a finger to reach
them
behind the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>. If this is the case, I have at least two small
switches in
the
garage <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Screw_Drawers01.jpg">amongst
the screws</a> that may be better suited for the panel. Replacing
the
switch
seems like a much easier and less risky task than replacing the LED on
my floppy drive. All I have to do is unscrew the switch from the
faceplate,
peel off the heat shrink, cut off the wires, then solder the new switch
in place. I found some really cool green LED switches online yesterday,
and I would have ordered some of them if they weren't bigger
than
my power button. But I just might go that route if the switches from
the
garage don't work, or if I can't find two matching ones.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just pried
off the
faceplate of my broken CD drive, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/BCDD_-_Broken_Tab.jpg">breaking
both tabs</a> in the process. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Square_LED01.jpg">CD
drive's LED</a> is yellow and rectangular and looks like it might
shine
pretty brightly. In fact, if this LED shines brighter than the one I
got
as part of an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Assorted_LEDs.jpg">assorted
set</a> from <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/" target="_top">Radio
Shack</a>,
I might use it in the floppy drive. I now plan to compare the
brightness
of one of the Radio Shack yellow LEDs with the LED on the CD drive
before
deciding which one to use. Then, I will attempt to replace the LED with
one from my assorted set, and if the replacement is successful, I'll
move
on to the floppy drive.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's about
twenty
minutes before midnight, and I just tried out my yellow LED on <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>.
I didn't have any more motherboard cables, so I resorted to simply touching the
LED directly to the Power LED pins on the motherboard. To my surprise,
the LED I thought was yellow <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Yellow_LED_-_Test.jpg">actually
glowed RED</a>, so I guess there's no point using it for the
floppy
disk.
I then tested one of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/3mm_Yellow_LED.jpg">3mm
yellow LEDs</a> in the same manner, but that too glowed red. At
that
point,
I was feeling pretty good about using the CD drive's yellow LED.
However,
when I hooked up the broken drive, and fired up the computer, nothing
happened.
After making a few adjustments and making sure the drive had power and
was plugged in, it was still a dead stick. Then, when I pushed down on
the
lipstick cap, the computer wouldn't turn off. At first, I thought my
homemade
power button finally succumbed to its junk origins, so I turned off the
power supply. When I switched back to Polyfragger's working CD drive,
the
computer could turn on and off as normal. Good news, my junk switch
still
worked fine. Bad news, my broken CD drive was so far along the lines of
FUBAR, the LED didn't even come on, AND it fucked up my test machine
during
its short stay. So I think you can guess that I'll have no compunction
about risking breaking something else in that POS when I pry out its
LED.
Hopefully, this yellow LED will actually be the color that its casing
suggests.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">2/4/2004 - Last
night,
mere minutes before midnight, I opened the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Parcel.jpg">box</a>
with my new <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">green
cold cathode fan grills</a>. After removing the bubble wrap, I
found
the
two grills in their packages stacked on top of each other. The glow
wires
on the grills appear white, but they should turn bright green once I
give
them some juice. I put one of my thin fans up against it, and their
screw
holes <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_Over_CCG01.jpg">lined
up perfectly</a>. I can't wait to take the grills out of their
packages,
but I've just developed a serious problem. I was about to take pictures
of my grills before I opened the boxes, but the camera wouldn't turn
on.
I thought that either the power cord wasn't plugged in properly, or the
power supply had gone bad. So I plugged out the camera and put in some
good batteries, and then tried to turn on the camera again, but I got nothing. If
I can't convince Jen and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
to lend me one of their cameras, I'll be be forced to have a photo log
blackout until my <a href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">piece
of shit Veo 1300</a> comes back to life again, if ever.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's nearly
three
o'clock in the afternoon, and I think I can try out my fan grills, and
still get a shot of them in their packages. I just discovered I can
open
the packages without damaging them. I can take a grill out of its box
and
do as I please with it, and as soon as I get a working camera, I can
put
it back in the box and take the necessary photos. Speaking of cameras,
Jen said that in addition to dropping off some milk and cereal, she
will
also let me use one of their digital cameras for a day, which is all I
need.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just opened
one
of the boxes of fan grills, and I'm examining its contents right now.
The
grill itself seems to have a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Wires.jpg">three
pin female Berg cable</a>. The smell in the package reminds me of
some
electronic toy I used to play with back in the 80s, something with a
grid
of flashing red lights. Whatever. There seems to be two connectors on
the
grill itself, and if I'm not mistaken, one is for the inner 29mm
glowing
ring, while the other is for the outer 70mm ring. Inside of the
package's
rectangular back protrusion are an assortment of items. One is a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Bag_Of_Screws.jpg">small
bag</a> with four long screws, as well as some matching nuts. I
can
drive
each screw into a corner of the grill, and it will keep going and pass
through the matching hole in the chassis, and the matching hole in the
fan. The nuts can then hold the screws in place. The tiny bag also has
a strip of velcro, although I'm not sure what it's for.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Also inside
the portrusion
is a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Blue_Box.jpg">light
blue long rectangular plastic box</a>. It has two ports on one
side
which
appear to be male two-pin ports. On the opposite side is some kind of a
smaller square-shaped two-pin male connector. I'm not sure what this
device
is, but the two cables on the fan seem to fit into the two ports of the
blue box, and something else apparently gets plugged into the smaller
cable.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The last item
in the
package is a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires01.jpg">multicolored
cable</a> with an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires02.jpg">expansion
bus faceplate</a> attached to it. There is a small, red constant
contact
switch on the faceplate, and my guess is that it turns the lights on
the
grill on and off. There are three connectors on the cable; a female
Molex,
a male Molex, and a tiny two-pin female connector that appears to be
plugged
into the blue box. I'm going upstairs to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
right after I finish this sentence to see just how bright this baby
glows.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I took one of
the
fan grills and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Fan&amp;Mount.jpg">thin
fan</a> I took out of the mount upstairs, and tested them out on
Polyfragger.
I carefully opened the fan grill's package and took out its contents,
making
sure to not do anything irreversible. I plugged the grill's two tiny
plugs
into the corresponding ports on the blue box, and the backplate switch
into its port on the blue box. I then plugged the switch's male Molex
plug
into a female Molex plug from Polyfragger's power supply. Once <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Test01.jpg">everything
was plugged in</a>, I turned on the computer, and then flipped
the
grill's
switch. The grill's rings which were white just a second ago <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Test02.jpg">turned
a bright green</a>, very bright in fact. Just to make things
interesting,
I turned off the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Ceiling_Fan.jpg">ceiling
light</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Test04.jpg">half
the room was green</a>. Impressive. Then, with the grill still in
place,
I plugged the fan's male Molex plug into what was probably the last
available
female Molex plug on the power supply, and turned on the computer. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_-_Test01.jpg">blades</a>
disappeared into a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_-_Test02.jpg">blur</a>
as the fan came to life. My finger got caught in the blades for a split
second, but it didn't hurt too much. My next step was to see how the
fan
and grill looked together, so I tried to screw them together with the
grill's
long screws. Unfortunately, the screws were only long enough to attach
the fan or the grill to the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a>, and could not go through all three. I'll have to find
eight
bolts from the garage that are just the right length for the job. When
I was done experimenting, I put the grill and all its parts back into
their
package, and brought all that and the fan back down to the kitchen.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's just
past 8PM,
and Jen showed up with a <a href="http://users.skynet.be/inforad/coolpix_macropfhoto.htm" target="_top">Nikon
Coolpix 995</a>, the really nice digital camera I used at her
house
while
working on my top hatch windows. Now I can go back in today's log, and
take the pictures I wasn't able to because of my Veo Capture 1300's
(AKA
POS13) breakdown. I only have this camera for one day, and I plan to
re-take
any pics that didn't come out well with the POS13.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The on/off
switches
on the fan grills' faceplates are attached to the plates by a screw on
either side. This means that I can take the screws off of their
faceplates,
and adapt them to fit behind my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>. All I have to do is cut the accommodating holes in the
panel,
then find a way to mount the switches solidly in place. The </font><font size="-2">EL
cable</font><font size="-2"> I'm planning
to buy for the
inner
rim for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/TpH_-_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a> windows will most likely have a switch of its own, and
I can
mount that switch right next to the fan grill switches.</font> </p>
