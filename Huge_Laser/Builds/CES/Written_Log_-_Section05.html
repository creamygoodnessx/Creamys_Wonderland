<hr width="100%">
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/22/2004 - It
looks
like I'll have to rethink how I'm going to put <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_05.jpg">my
chassis</a> together. Since I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/2D_GIF_Animations/Chassis_Construction01/Chassis_Construction01.gif">first
laid out the chassis</a> last night, I've noticed that on the
inside,
there
is a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Internal_Gap.jpg">small
gap</a> on each side where the outside can be seen. Last night, I
came
up with a potential solution to this problem. I reassembled
the chassis, but I laid out the beams in a different order;
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">7"
angles</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_01.jpg">on
the sides</a>, then the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">12"
angles</a> on the back and front sides placed on top of the 7"
angles,
then the 12" x 7" <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_02.jpg">inside
the angle irons</a>, then the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">4"
angles</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_03.jpg">on
the corners</a> standing on end on the outside edges, then the
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Aluminum_Sheet%287x4%29.jpg">side</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back</a>
panels <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_04.jpg">between
the 4" angles</a> and the rest of the chassis, and finally the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel05.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_05.jpg">on
the outside edges</a> of the 4" angles.</font></p><p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white; text-align: center;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/2D_GIF_Animations/Chassis_Construction02/Chassis_Construction02.gif"><img src="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/2D_GIF_Animations/Chassis_Construction02/Chassis_Construction02.gif" nosave="" style="border: 2px solid ; width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt="Chassis Construction Simulation 2" hspace="3" vspace="3"></a> </p><p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; This configuration
reduced the
interior side gaps to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Corner_Gap.jpg">tiny
gaps in the corners</a>, and looked to make the side and back
panels
more
secure. However, having the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Side01.jpg">corner
beams in front of the side panels</a> meant that some of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim10.jpg">pixelated
flames</a> will be covered up, and this made me second guess the
new
design.
But right now, I'm thinking that having the side panels partially
covered
may not be such a bad thing after all, if I can find a way to decorate
the corner beams. I'm thinking that a <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/series/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> brick, or <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=loz" target="_top">Legend of Zelda</a> floor tile paintjob would help to enhance my
computer's
retro
gaming / crude look.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I may have to
cut
the ends of my horizontal angle irons, so that the four beams interlock
neatly. If I do this, I can get rid of the corner gaps, but I'm not
sure
how I'd connect the beams together. If I leave the beams the way they
are,
I can drill a hole at the end of each one, and use screws to hold them
together. I plan to ask <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
for his advice in this area. While comparing the lengths of two of the
12" angles, I noticed that one was slightly longer than another. I'll
have
to somehow make sure all of the beams of each length are truly the same
length.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; My current
chassis
design will <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_True_Depth02.jpg">add
over half an inch to its depth</a>, because the 1/8" thick angle
irons
add length to the back in two places, with the 1/16" back panel between
them, and there are two places&nbsp;in the front where the 1/8" angle
irons extend the width by another quarter inch. The distance between
the
back panel and the front of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy</a>
and </font><font style="color: white;" size="-2">CD</font><font size="-2">
drives is 7 3/4". The floppy drive is the deeper of the two, and it
measures
about 5 3/4". If I decide to get an 80x80x25mm fan, I'll have a whole
inch
between the front of the fan, and the back of the floppy drive, meaning
I may not have to settle for a thin fan after all.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; After a lot
of measuring,
I think I figured out the best way to get a 25mm thick fan to work in
my
chassis. The biggest concern I had was the fact that the hard drive
rests
only a half inch away from the front of the fan. If I'm going to get
this
fan to work in my chassis, it is mandatory that the hard drive's Molex
power connector not pass in front of it. I figured that if I move the
hard
drive to the left, almost touching the motherboard, this should allow
the
80mm fan to fit in between the back right 4" angle iron, and the hard
drive's
Molex connector. This way, the Molex won't be touching the fan, and I
won't
have to cut into the 4" angle iron to mount it. However, I'll still
have
to cut a centimeter-deep notch in the top and bottom angle irons where
the fan will be mounted. My measurements will have to be precise, so I
won't know if the fan will actually fit until I buy it and try it in
the
case with the hard drive and with the drive's plugs in place.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I'm going to
take
a chance and assume that an 80mm x 25mm fan will fit in my chassis.
After
a bit of online shopping, I found a 4 LED fan that's a nice shade of
green
on <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>
for
just $4.99. This should replace the $10.99 thin fan I was going to buy.
If this fan can't fit in CES, I'll have to return it and just settle
for
the thin fan.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I'm
considering moving
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_BSCDD_In_Bay.jpg">CD
drive bay</a> a little to the left. It's not going to be easy;
this
involves
not only cutting more space to the left of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay.jpg">bay
hole</a> in my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel05.jpg">front
panel</a>, but also sealing up as much of the right side that I
take
from
the left. I can do this by melting down a small chunk of the top half
of
my cart piece with an open flame, then using it to patch the right edge
of the bay hole. I have two reasons for doing this. First, a small
piece
of my skeleton's front right 4" beam <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CDD_Bay_Hole_-_Blocked.jpg">shows
through the hole</a>, and moving the hole will solve this
problem.
Second,
it could allow my CD drive to be centered above the floppy bay hole,
not
too far to the right or left. I had to move my floppy drive over to the
left in order to accommodate the fan, and since I can't have both
drives
aligned to the right edge, I might as well center one on top of the
other.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just
decided ran
a little test to see if I could use an 80mm x 25mm fan in CES. I found
a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Molex_Cable.jpg">Molex</a>
and an <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/IDE_Cable.jpg">IDE</a>
connector, and plugged them into my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive.jpg">broken
hard drive</a>. I then placed the hard drive where my new one
will go
in
the chassis. In a drawer in the kitchen, I found some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Toothpick_Boxes.jpg">boxes
of toothpicks</a>, which were roughly the same depth as a 25mm
thick
fan.
I had trouble <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Fan_Space_Test01.jpg">placing
one of the toothpick boxes behind the drive</a>, and that's when
I
realized
that a thick fan just wasn't going to cut it. Even though the Molex
cable just
missed the box, the IDE cable kept brushing against it. So it's back to
the thin fan for me.</font> </p>

too
expensive, or were facing the wrong way. Then, I realized that the
riser
card I was planning on buying on mini-itx.com faced the wrong way; its
PCI
cards would face away from the motherboard, which would be well outside
the chassis. The card is not reversible, so I can't have the PCI cards
rest above the motherboard. This riser will obviously be taken out of
the
budget, and until I can find a riser I can use and afford, CES will
have
to make do without one.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_-_Aluminum_Parts01.jpg">aluminum
chassis parts</a> arrived in the mail today, and they weighed
around
four
pounds total, just as I had calculated before I ordered it. The <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Aluminum_-_Parcel.jpg">package</a>
was a little heavier than I had imagined it, and the sheets seemed a
bit
small, but this is probably because I'm not used&nbsp;to any computer
chassis
being this size. At the time I ordered the aluminum, I was worried the
sheets would be too flimsy, but when I took the sheets out of the
package,
I was surprised at the strength of the material. I decided to lay
out the materials on the kitchen table, so I can see how it
will
look
once I screw everything together. I could tell the materials were
freshly
cut, because there were some shavings at the ends of some of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Angle_Irons01.jpg">angle
irons</a>. I began by putting the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">four
inch angles</a> on the corners, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_01.jpg">standing
them on end</a> with the corners facing outward. I then put two
of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">foot-long
angles</a> horizontally on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_02.jpg">far
and near sides</a>, on the inside edge of the four inch angles,
with
the
outer edges facing outward. Next was the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg">seven
inch angles</a>, which I put on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_03.jpg">left
and right sides</a>, their ends on top of the foot long angles,
outside
edges out. I then leaned the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Aluminum_Sheet%287x4%29.jpg">7" x 4" panels</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_04.jpg">on
the sides</a> of the makeshift skeleton, the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">12" x 4" panel</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_05.jpg">on
the back</a>, and my plastic <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel05.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction01_06.jpg">on
the front</a>. Finally, I placed the big 12" x 7" <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a> in the middle of the chassis, on top of the
horizontally laid
angle irons. The 1/8" thickness of the angle irons gave me a tiny bit
of
extra space on either side of each panel. Because of this, the front
panel
fit over the front of the skeleton perfectly, instead of being a
quarter
inch too wide on either side. Also, I'll have a little extra space
inside,
and this should relieve some space issues I've been having, such as my
lack of clearance for my back fan. Because of the protruding front panel,
and
the motherboard's I/O ports that will stick out the back, the depth of
the chassis will probably be about eight inches, rather than the
original
seven.</font></p><p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white; text-align: center;"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/2D_GIF_Animations/Chassis_Construction01/Chassis_Construction01.gif"><img src="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/2D_GIF_Animations/Chassis_Construction01/Chassis_Construction01.gif" nosave="" style="border: 2px solid ; width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt="Chassis Construction Simulation 1" hspace="3" vspace="3"></a> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I next laid
out the
pieces for the top of the chassis. I put down the two <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Aluminum_Sheet%287x4%29.jpg">6"
x 7" sheets</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Sim01_01.jpg">side
by side</a>, placed two seven inch beams on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Sim01_02.jpg">left
and right sides</a>, and then the foot long beams on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Sim01_03.jpg">near
and far sides</a> so that their ends rested on top of the seven
inch
angles.
This gave me a good idea at what the top of CES was going to look like
from underneath. After I finished doing this, I found that I somehow
had
an extra 7" x 4" panel. This is actually good news, because I can use
this
piece as backup if I make a mistake while painting the flames on the
side
panels, or if I need some extra scrap metal for the interior mounts.</font>

was not the ideal power supply for CES. This is because the PW-70A is
optimized
for the <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=81" target="_top">VIA
EPIA M</a><a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=81" target="_top"> series</a> of motherboards, but CES will use an EPIA
V board. Therefore, the PW-60A
will be a better choice for my power supply, since it is universal for
the entire mini-itx form factor, including the EPIA V. Furthermore,
ituner
also sold an ATX
power supply extension cable, which looks like something I can use
to not have to mount the PW-60 directly onto the motherboard, but
rather
near the ceiling of the chassis where it won't get in the way of the
riser
card's future PCI cards. The PW-60A costs $54.95, which is exactly the
same price as the PW-70A. However, the extension cable costs $5.95, so
that'll raise my budget yet again.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Since I last
considered
the price of the two </font><font size="-2">512MB
SDRAM DIMMs</font><font size="-2"> I was
planning on getting
on <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com" target="_top">mini-itx.com</a>,
the
price or each RAM stick has been jacked up from $88 to $96.25.
Naturally,
this motivated me to shop around the Web a little, and I eventually
stumbled
upon a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Ultra_512MB_PC133_SDRAM_Memory_2_Pack.jpg" target="_top">two-pack</a>
of the same ram sticks I was going to get on mini-tix.com. The two-pack
was sold on <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/" target="_top">TigerDirect.com</a>,
and it sold for $179.99, which is a much better deal that paying
$192.50
for the same thing at mini-itx.com. Since I was originally going to pay
$176 for RAM, but now I'm paying $179.99 for it, I'll have to increase
my budget yet again, this time by $3.99.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It seems that
there
was a bit of confusion on my part as to what the PW-60A power supply
actually
is. I thought that it was roughly the size of the motherboard, and it
would
get in the way of my riser card components. As it turns out, I
misinterpreted
the pics on the ituner site, and that the PW-60 is about the size of a
stick of RAM, and is not likely to interfere with the riser card. I can
mount it directly to the motherboard's power port without needing the
ATX
extension cable, so that's something that can come off my budget right
away.</font> </p>

days
ago, I found something really cool on <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>.
I can add a nice green glow effect to CES by buying some EL
cable, which is a glowing wire that gives off very little
heat, and
can be bent into any shape you want. I plan on using this cable on the
edges of the windows of my top hatch doors. The cable goes for $9.50,
and
I'm getting mine in green.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I never
really liked
the shade of green of the Quake
III Arena fan grill I've had my eye on for the past few days.
I've
always thought of that green as a bluish green rather than what I
consider
a "true green" like the EL cable I'm getting. There's a cold cathode
fan
grill on <a href="http://www.frozencpu.com/cgi-bin/frozencpu/index.html" target="_top">FrozenCPU.com</a>
that has a glow that's almost the same shade of green as the EL cable,
and it only costs two dollars more than the Q3A grill. So I've decided
to get the cold cathode grill instead of the Q3A one.</font> </p>

loved
to get a 40mm green lighted fan, but after searching the Web high and
low
for several days, I came up empty handed. I managed to find three LED
40mm
fans, one <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Directron_MW-4010M12S_LED_Sleeve_Case_Fans.jpg">blue</a>,
one <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Tri-Lighted_Video_Card_-_GPU_Cooler,_40mm_Fan.jpg">three
colored</a>, and the other four colored, all on Directron. Now
that I
have
two bright green lights in my system, I don't think getting a
multi-colored
fan will throw off my system's green-based color scheme too much,
especially
since one of the lights in the three and four-colored fans is green. I
have my eye on the four colored fan. It's only seven bucks, but it's
sold
out right now and there's no ETA, so I'm going to have to keep checking
back until its available. I could just get the three LED fan, but it
has
one LED less but still costs three bucks more, so I'm sticking with the
Quad-LED.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/19/2004 - Just
on
a whim, I took a close look at my custom made <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a> this morning. I unwrapped the electrical tape from the
contact
point that the white wire is attached to. The exposed wire was almost
completely
off the contact point, and had apparently been slowly pulling itself
loose
for the past few weeks. Not only that, but the half the wire past the
white
sheathing was gone. I put the wire back into position and put the tape
back, but that's not going to be enough in the long run. What really
surprises
me about my power switch is the irony that it's built almost entirely
out
of junk, but yet its weakest point is the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Custom_Power_Cable.jpg">store-bought cable</a>. When I go
to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
place this
upcoming
weekend, I plan to bring my power switch and the same <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red&amp;Yellow_Cable.jpg">red
and yellow cable</a> I used to test my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs01.jpg">LEDs</a>
with. I will then remove the motherboard
cable from the switch, cut it down to mere centimeters, cut
off a
foot-long
portion of the red and yellow cable, attach one end to the switch's
contacts,
and the other end to the severed motherboard cable's jumper block.
Then,
with JD's supervision, I will solder the r&amp;y cable to the mb
cable,
then insulate the connection with electrical tape. The red and yellow
cable
is far stronger than the motherboard cable, and using it should make my
power switch much more sturdy.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/18/2004 - I have
a
new concern about the interior components of the Creamy Entertainment
System.
I was looking at some online pics of some of the components I plan on
buying
for CES, trying to determine how my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">motherboard</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/Via_Dual_PCI_Riser_Card.jpg">riser
card</a>, and PW-70A
external power supply would fit onto the back
panel. It soon occurred to me that I may not be able to use
both
the
riser and the PW-70, since the PW-70 is apparently fitted directly to
the
motherboard's power connector without the use of wires. This means that
the PW-70 is mounted just above the motherboard, taking up the same
space
any PCI cards connected to the riser would. If I cant find a way to
mount
the PW-70 above the riser, I won't be able to use any PCI cards in my
system.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/17/2004 - It's
almost
4AM, and I just thought I'd get a little last minute work on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel03.jpg">front
panel</a> done before heading off to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s.
I'm currently working on the hole for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED01.jpg">HDD
LED</a>, and before I could begin cutting the hole, I had to cut
off <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/HDDLH_-_Cut_Rails01.jpg">two
rails</a> from the back of the panel, which were on the opposite
side
as
the future HDD LED hole. I used a similar method to the one I used
yesterday,
when I needed to test my </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font><font size="-2">
on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Top_Half.jpg">top
half of the cart piece</a>. But this time, things didn't go as
smoothly.
I accidentally made two dents, which showed through&nbsp;the front of the
panel, right on top of the space for the HDD LED. If that wasn't bad
enough,
I made a mid-sized crack, which also showed through the panel's front
and
was also on the HDD LED's space. Now, when I chisel the LED hole, I
have
to be extra careful not to make the crack any bigger.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I'm done with
the
task of cutting out my HDD LED hole, and it went surprisingly smoothly.
I used the same technique I used to make my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Hole_OK.jpg">reset
button hole</a>; etching the outline, deepening the corners with
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Yellow_Box_Cutter.jpg">box
cutter</a>, chiseling through the corners with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Thin_Screwdriver.jpg">thin
screwdriver</a>, then chiseling around the parimeter to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/HDDLH_-_Freshly_Cut.jpg">take
out the middle</a>, then carving out the edges until the hole was
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/HDDLH_-_Right_Size.jpg">just
the right size</a>. When I put the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_Top03.jpg">Schweppes
bottle top</a>,
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">red
cap</a>, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sawed-off_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">sawed-off
lipstick cap</a> in their places, I found that the bottle top was
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Switch&amp;LED_Positioning01.jpg">off
to the left</a> of the reset button hole. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Switch&amp;LED_Positioning02.jpg">Moving
the bottle top to the right</a> solved this, but it also put it
off-center
from the LED shades below it. When I moved the power LED slightly to
the
right, my bottle top was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Switch&amp;LED_Positioning03.jpg">fairly
centered</a> between the other components. So now, I'll have to
scrape
off the cut lines for my power button and power LED, and redraw them in
their correct positions.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I'm not yet
ready
to glue the red cap into place, because I'm not going to trust JD's
drill
until I see it in action; I don't want to take a chance in damaging the
cap. Once the drill holes for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
switch</a> and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED01.jpg">power
LED</a> are in place, I will glue both LED caps and the bottle
top to
their
places permanently. The sun's coming up, and I guess the only thing to
do now is clean up <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Kitchen_-_Dirty01.jpg">the
mess</a> in the kitchen I've been making for the past nine days.
Then
I'll
have something to eat and get some shut-eye before JD picks me up.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I scraped off
the
cut lines for the power button and power LED with the thin screwdriver,
and then used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite
Out</a> to re-stamp them in their <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel05.jpg">new
positions</a>. After that, it took me about an hour twenty to get
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Kitchen_-_Clean01.jpg">kitchen
clean</a>. My uncle Jimmy called a little over an hour ago and
offered
to take me to <a href="http://www.daveandbusters.com/" target="_top">Dave
&amp; Busters</a> in the <a href="http://www.palisadescenter.com/" target="_top">Palisades
Center</a>, and at first I thought I couldn't
make
it because of my drilling session at JD's house. However, I called JD
right
after I finished talking with Jimmy to tell him about a possible change
of plans, but Jen answered and said that JD was asleep with a headache.
Oh well, it looks like I'll have to wait until next weekend to drill my
front panel holes. This actually works out pretty well, since the
aluminum
for my chassis isn't scheduled to arrive until Wednesday the 21st, and
the lexan is scheduled to get here within seven business days since I
ordered
it. But for now, I'm off to </font><font size="-2">Dave

cousins.</font> </p>

panel</a>. Once again, something I thought would take less than
an hour
went on all day, and past midnight into the next day. I began the task
by <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_-_Flatten.jpg">stepping
on</a> the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_-_Empty.jpg">empty
Schweppes bottle</a> to flatten it, so that it wouldn't roll all
over
the
place as I tried to behead it. Then, using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Long_Hacksaw.jpg">long
hacksaw</a>, I cut off <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_Top01.jpg">the
top of the bottle</a>. It was very crooked, so I had to cut and
sand it
down vigorously until it was fairly even. I placed it over my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a> to see how it would look, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Power_Button02.jpg">green
and white color combination</a> impressed me. The top of the
button ran
along the top of the bottle top, so I considered it to be a good fit.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; My plan then
was to
make all four marks for the buttons and shades on the left of the front
panel.
I would mark the circle for the Schweppes bottle top first, and then
base
the other marks on that. I tried the same method of marking the cut
lines
for the bottle top I used before; <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_Top03.jpg">marking
the bottom</a> of the bottle top with a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/White_Pencil.jpg">white
pencil</a>, then pressing it onto the spot on the front panel
where I
wanted
its hole to be drilled. However, when I tried pressing the bottle top
on,
it kept sliding uncontrollably as I pressed and twisted it in place,
and
even when I did keep it relatively steady, the mark was almost
non-exsistant.
So then I tried using dabs of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glue</a> to hold the bottle top in place, then covered it with
its cap
and pounded on it with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Rubber_Mallet.jpg">rubber
mallet</a>. That didn't work either, and that put me out of ideas
for
the
time being.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The only
thing I could
think of doing then was cutting down the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Clear_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">clear
lipstick cap</a> to the size of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">red
cap</a>. I stood <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LED_Caps_-_Comparison.jpg">both
caps next to each other upside down</a> in order to get a general
idea
as to where to begin cutting. I then hacksawed the cap <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Lipstick_Cap_-_Halves.jpg">down
to size</a>, but ended up putting two cracks in it. I wasn't
about to
let
my work go to waste, so I decided to still use the cap anyway. I sanded
down the rough edges, and considered the cap <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sawed-off_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">good
to go</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I went back
to trying
to mark my four cut marks, but this time with acrylic paint instead of
the pencil. But I soon found that to be a bit too messy, and so I
switched
to using <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite
Out</a>. This turned out to be a good choice, because as I soon
found
out,
Wite Out can scrape off once it dries completely. The Wite Out left
thicker
lines than I would have liked, but it was fairly cooperative and
actually
stuck to the surface of the front panel. After I using the Schweppes
bottle
top to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Left_Marks01.jpg">mark
the hole</a> for the power button, I put the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_01.jpg">reset
switch</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Measurement.jpg">on
the panel</a> where it was to go underneath, and used the white
pencil
to draw its outline. I then used the red cap to make a Wite Out outline
of the reset button's location. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Left_Marks02.jpg">Putting
the sawed-off lipstick cap in the power button's cut circle</a>
in
place
of the larger Schweppes top gave me a better idea as to where the
middle
of the circle was, and this helped me to put the reset button's mark
over
the center of the power button. It took me a few tries to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Left_Marks04.jpg">get
this right</a>, and because I was using Wite Out to draw the
lines, it
was easy to scrape off if I marked something wrong. Finally, after a
short
break, I put the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Left_Marks05.jpg">LED
caps into position</a>, and tried to get them to rest an equal
horizontal
distance away from the power button. When I was satisfied of the caps'
positions, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Left_Marks06.jpg">marked
their locations</a> with the Wite Out.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; The first
holes I
plan to make are the ones for the power button and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED01.jpg">power LED</a>. These two
holes are round, and with <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
help, I can use his drill to bore out their holes. After this is done,
I will use the chisel and cut method I used for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay.jpg">CD
drive bay hole</a> to make the holes for the reset button and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED01.jpg">HDD
LED</a>, which are rectangular. I've never seen his drill in
action,
and
I'm worried that if I cut the holes for the rectangular holes first,
drilling
the round holes would break the panel. On the other hand, chiseling the
rectangular holes after the round ones are made could break the panel
too.
I'll have to study the panel further before deciding which holes to
make
first.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's now
11:30PM,
and I finished the reset button hole in my front panel a few hours ago.
But before I did that, I tested to see if a hole the size of my red cap
would be big enough for the button to poke through the panel. The
rectangular
holes on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cart_Piece_-_Top_Half.jpg">top
half of the cart piece</a> were just the right width for the
button,
but
before I could push the button through one of them, I'd have to cut off
the rails on either side of a hole. I picked a hole on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_Cut_Rails01.jpg">top
right corner</a> of the cart piece, and cut off its rails with
the same
method I used to cut the protrusions when making my CD drive bay hole.
After using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Yellow_Box_Cutter.jpg">box
cutter</a> to cut starting notches on the rails, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_Cut_Rails02.jpg">chiseled
down the rest of the way</a> with the box cutter, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Thin_Screwdriver.jpg">thin
screwdriver</a>, and rubber mallet. I then used the box cutter to
cut a
horizontal gash along the base of each rail, and chiseled the rails off
with the screwdriver. Once the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_Cut_Rails03.jpg">rails
were gone</a>, I pushed the reset switch <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_RsB_Test%28Back%29.jpg">through
the back of the hole</a>, so that its button <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/CPT_-_RsB_Test%28Front%29.jpg">stuck
out the front</a>. There was plenty of room to push the button
through
the front, without cutting the edges diagonally.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Now that I
knew the
button would have enough space, I proceeded to cut out the real reset
button
hole on my front panel. First, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_Braced.jpg">braced
the back of the panel</a> with two rulers and an eraser, so that
the
panel
wouldn't bend as I chiseled. I then used the box cutter to scrape and
chisel
the outline of the button. I focussed especially on the corners, since
that is always the toughest part to cut through. When the notches were
as deep as the box cutter could get them, I used the screwdriver and
mallet
to chisel the hole deeper. I did this with all four corners, and then
with
the sides. I then pried the rectangle out with the screwdriver. When I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/RsB_-_Panel_Test.jpg">tested
the hole</a> with the button, it wasn't long enough, so I had to
cut it
bigger with the box cutter. Once the hole was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Hole_OK.jpg">the
right size</a>, I made the button a little easier to push by
cutting
the
sides of the hole at an angle, making more room for whatever finger
would
push the button.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Tomorrow, I'm
headed
to JD's place to drill the round holes for the power button and power
LED.
I promised myself I would study for my <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>
exam this week, but my CES project kept getting in the way. This is
going
to get even worse once the parts for my chassis arrive in the mail. But
hell, I'm not complaining. I don't get to build things to often with my
own two hands, and there will be plenty of time to study once I join my
parents in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>
in February.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/14/2004 - Early
this
morning, I drew the first visual plans of the interior of CES on graph
paper. I did the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Blueprints_-_Top01.jpg">top</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Blueprints_-_Front01.jpg">front</a>
views of the system, and included the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Shopping_List_Pics/VIA_EPIA-V10000A_Mini-ITX_Mainboard.jpg">motherboard</a>,
case
fan, and all drives. I omitted the floppy and hard drives from the
front view, because I'm still not sure of their precise vertical
location.
Each square on the grid represented a half inch, and I rounded all of
the
components dimensions to the next quarter inch, just to play it safe.
As
a result of my drawn plans, I found that the 80mm fan, which is 25mm
thick,
would only be a quarter-inch away from the back of the floppy drive,
and
may not leave enough room for the floppy's cables. I thought that
putting
two smaller fans in place of the 80mm would do the trick, but I
couldn't
find any case fans smaller than 80mm that glowed green. But then, I
discovered
that some fan grills have cold cathode lights built into them, but
found
that such grills didn't come in sizes smaller than 80mm. However, less
than an hour ago (it's about 6:15 now), I found some 80mm fans that
were
only 15mm thick, as opposed to the usual 25mm, but they didn't have any
lights on them. Ten millimeters may not seem like much of a difference,
but in a compact case, it can mean everything. Now that my case fan is
nearly a half inch further away from the floppy drive, there may be
enough
room for the cables of all the drives. I have yet to find an LED thin
fan,
but I'm still looking. Even if I can't find one, the LED fan grill
should
cover for it. I will adjust my project's budget as soon as I decide
exactly
which fan and grill to buy.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Here's
something else
I found while shopping online. I found a site called <a href="http://freckleface.com/" target="_top">FreckleFace.com</a>
that sells lexan, much like <a href="http://www.polymerplastics.com/" target="_top">Polymer
Plastics</a>. However, FF doesn't charge an outrageous $25 cut
fee like
PP did. I can get two eighth inch-thick lexan panels for $7.80 total,
but
FF has a purchase minimum of ten dollars. So I'll ask <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
if he needs any lexan for the subwoofer he's building, so I can meet
this
requirement.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I just talked
to JD
on the phone about my fan clearance. He reminded me to take the floppy
power cables into consideration when trying to figure out if there is
going
to be enough space between floppy drive and the fan. I also asked him
if
he needed a piece of lexan for his sub-woofer, but he said that lexan
would
not be a good material to use on his project. He instead suggested that
I fill in Freckle Face's $10 minimum with a third panel of lexan as a
backup
should anything go wrong with one I'm using for CES's top hatches. I
agreed
with his suggestion, and now I plan to buy three lexan panels, costing
a total of $11.70.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; After talking
with
JD, I planned to switch to a laptop floppy drive, in order to save
space
for my fan. But after searching the web and finding the cheapest one to
be around fifty bucks, I thought to myself, "fuck that, it's not worth
it", and decided to find a way to get <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">Polyfragger's
floppy drive</a> to work out somehow. I soon realized that there
was a
bit of space behind the floppy on the left side (from the front) where
the fan didn't pass behind it. I then remembered from the last
time
I saw the floppy that its power connector was small, and was almost all
the way to one side, but I couldn't remember which side. It turned out
to be on the left side, which was the side that will face the
motherboard.
I took another look at the blueprints of CES's interior, and found that
the first three quarters of an inch of the floppy's left side was clear
of the fan. But when I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">my ruler</a> to measure how much space I needed
for the floppy's power plug to miss the fan, I found that an eighth of
an inch of the plug would pass in front of the fan. Desperate for more
space, I re-measured the width of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Floppy_Drive.jpg">broken
floppy drive</a>. As it turns out, the width was not exactly four
inches,
but one sixteenth of an inch shy of four inches. I re-examined the
floppy
drive in Polyfragger, and found it to have about a sixteenth of an inch
of clearance from the sides of the drive bay. This meant that the fan
would
miss the first seven eighths of the floppy drive's width, and that the
floppy's plug would not pass in front of the fan.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; Switching to
the slimmer
fan meant that it would rest almost a half inch further away from the
back
of the floppy drive, so instead of being a quarter inch away from the
floppy,
the distance between the two devices would now be three quarters of an
inch. I decided to re-measure the length of my broken floppy drive, and
it turned out to be much closer to five and three quarter inches deep
than
six. This gave me nearly an extra quarter inch of space between the
floppy
and fan, which brings the distance to almost an inch. Since the
floppy's
power cable will be just off to the side of the fan's line of sight,
and
its motherboard connector won't stick very far out of the
back,&nbsp;I
think I might have just enough space to mount the fan.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">1/13/2004 -
Yesterday,
I went to babysit my nephews yet again. When <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
came to pick me up, I explained how far I had come with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel02.jpg">front
panel</a>, and that I still needed to make holes for the buttons
and
LED
shades. He suggested that the best way to make such holes was to drill,
and to use a special drill bit that's meant to make bigger than normal
holes. I don't know if this drill bit has a special name or how to
use
it, but I'll call my dad after I get off work today and ask him for
some
advice about it. Just before I left for home, I asked Jen if she had
any
green Sharpie permanent markers that I could use to draw the pixelated
flames on my side panels. Fortunately, she had <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpies%28Green%29.jpg">two
shades of green</a> I could use, but after I got home that day, I
realized
that I the white Sharpie I thought I had was actually silver. So when I
finally remember to return to Jen the Sharpies that I can't use, I'll
try
to remember to ask for a white one.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's about a
quarter
to six in the evening, and I just called up my parents in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>
so I can ask my dad about the drill bit JD mentioned yesterday. My dad
suggested that using such a drill bit could be dangerous, because if
the
drill jams, the torque can hurt your wrist very badly. Also, you'd need
to have it firmly clamped to something, like a vice. Our only vice is
in
the garage, and it's less than ten degrees outside, so that's out of
the
question. However, dad did suggest talking to JD about using his table
power drill, since it could probably do a better job of making my front
panel's power button hole than my dad's hand-held power drill.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; It's almost
7PM, and
I just got off the phone with JD. We agreed that this coming weekend
would
be a good time to work on the front panel. He needs time to clear out
his
shop for a sub-woofer he's building, and I need to give my chassis
parts
time to arrive from <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/" target="_top">Seattle</a>, so it works out pretty well. I also
brought
up the issue about air flow that JD first mentioned yesterday. This is
something he agreed to help me with, but he made me realize that I
never
made any drawings of what the inside of CES is going to look like. I've
been planning to produce a few 3D images of CES's interior ever since
the
start of the project, but never really got to it. I still have do some
recapping of my <a href="http://www.comptia.org/" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>
studies today, so I'll try to devote tomorrow to my 3D modeling.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt; I finished
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_-_Empty.jpg">bottle
of Schweppes</a> today, and when I can find the time, I will
rinse out
the bottle and hacksaw its top off. However, I noticed that the white
plastic
ring just below the cap was uneven. I used the handle end of a pair of
nail clippers to pry the lowest part of the ring upwards, and then
screwed
the cap back into place tightly, and that evened out the ring. I'll
have
to apply a bit of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Krazy_Glue.jpg">Krazy
Glue</a> to the ring to get it to stay in place.</font></p>
