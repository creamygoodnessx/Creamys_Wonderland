- It's
almost
1PM, and I just thought of a way to accurately paint the white portions
of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons02.jpg">angle
irons</a>. For the past few weeks, I've been searching for a
white
permantent
marker with a fine enough tip to paint the pixels without going over
the
grid lines. I couldn't find such a marker, and was ready to give up on
the white and put the finishing coat on the angle irons without it. But
just now, I figured that if I can make a cardboard eraser shield of the
parts I wanted to paint, I could use my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch1%28White%29.jpg">1.0
Pen-touch marker</a> to fill in the white pixels without painting
over
the other colors. There aren't that many white areas, and I'd only have
to make eraser shields of the following shapes; the outer rim of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">Fire
Flower</a>'s oval, the eyes of the Koopa Troopa, the three pixels
of
the
KT's shell highlight which I can also use for the shell's edges, and a
four-bar tetrad for the rest of shell's edges.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The next
thing that
occurred to me was that if I could use this masking technique for the
white
pixels, I may be able to use it for the light green ones as well. The
angle
irons only have one shape that will be colored light green; the
trapazoid
shape of the 3D blocks. Each block has one such shape on the top and on
the left sides. Therefore, I only need to make one trapezoid shaped
mask
for the blocks, and then fill in all of the light green pixels with my
sister <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Light_Green%29.jpg">Jennifer's
light green Sharpie marker</a>. This means that I won't have to
buy the
fresh green <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a> anymore.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
This left
only the
yellow pixels un-accounted for. I figured that if I am to use the light
green Sharpie in place of a fresh green Pigma Micron, I can also save
money
by borrowing a yellow Sharpie from Jen. I could then using the same
eraser
shield technique for <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2933.jpg">Mario</a>'s
skin and suspender buttons, the coins, and middle rim of the Fire
Flower.
I'm going to be busy reading the book for my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>

today.</font> </p>

Yesterday
morning, I found a bottle of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
in the small wooden drawer on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Pay_Table.jpg" target="_top">pay
table</a>. This is the same bottle that I used to mark the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel03.jpg" target="_top">cut
lines</a> for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a> components back in January. There is a wedge-shaped
rubber
brush
attatched to the cap, and when I get a chance, I will test it out on my
second top hatch aluminum scrap sheet. If the brush passes the test, I
will then use it to paint the white parts of the flames on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Side_Panels02.jpg">side
panels</a>. The flames are based on 5mm square grids, and if I
have no
problems filling them in, I may then use the brush on the much smaller
1/16" squares of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">Fire
Flower</a> and Koopa Troopa angle irons.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
During this
morning's
pre-dawn hours, I decided to once again search the house for discarded
items, so I can eventually use them in CES. I had to keep it down,
because
I didn't want to awaken my cousin Marie or my parents. About a month
ago,
I lost track of my grandmother's clock radio, and to this day I'm
regretting
not grabbing it and stuffing it into my closet when I had the chance.
At
the time, I didn't realize exactly how perfect it was as a potential
four-button
switch board for my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Packages.jpg">cold
cathode fan grills</a>. It had four white small constant contact
buttons,
lined up in a row, and the buttons had a good feel to them to. I don't
understand what could have happened to it; it was in the back of the
<a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/maxima" target="_top">Maxima</a>,
and my dad said he didn't touch it. I may or may not have taken it out,
and if I did, I sure as hell don't remember what I did with it. On the
off chance it ever does come up again, I'm going to sieze it and duct
tape
its ass to my closet so it can't escape. But I don't think I will ever
see it again, so I'm still fishing around for another potential
switchboard,
or at least a front panel plate for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_-_Power_Wires03.jpg">grills'
existing switches</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
While in the
basement,
I was digging through the two bottom drawers of the bookcase, and I
came
up with a couple of things I thought I could someday use for CES,
including
a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AV_Cable.jpg">thin
audio/video wire</a>. If I ever to get around to replacing the
wire on
my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">junk
power button</a>, I felt that this A/V wire would be a good
choice. I
also
found a clear, unopened <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Mystery_Bag.jpg">plastic
bag</a> that had strange items in it. It also contained four
long, thin
screws, which I thought would be good replacements for the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Bag_Of_Screws.jpg">ones</a>
that came with my fan grills. The screws I already had were too short
to
pass through the mounting holes of a grill, then through the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom</a> or
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back</a> panel, and then through the mounting holes of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Fan.jpg">fan</a>. So I took
the
bag upstairs, and without opening it, I checked to see if a screw
inside
would fit through the fan holes, which it did. But when I tested the
screw
on the holes on one of my grills, the screw was too wide, so I had to
return
the bag to where I got it.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Without my
grandmother's
clock radio, I was forced to look for alternatives for my fan grill
switch
mounting plate for my front panel. At first, I considered using the
buttons
on a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Broken_Sony_CFS-204.jpg">busted
CFS-204 Radio Cassette-Corder</a> as my grill buttons, but after
I
figured
out how they worked, I realized that they were no use to me. The
buttons'
holes were the right size for my existing fan grill switches, but the
buttons
had a concaved parimeter around them, which would prevent me from
attatching
the switches on securely. I also considered tearing apart my NES
Advantage
joystick and using its constant contact switches, but I just didn't
have
the heart to destroy a controller that's been so good to me, even if I
may never use it again. I then considered my other controllers when
looking
for a posible faceplate. The only controller I was willing to chop down
was an 8-button controller I got from </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.radioshack.com/">Radio
Shack</a></font><font size="-2">, but
the buttons on it rested on
a concaved pattern, which prevented me from securely attaching my
switches
to the buttons' holes. So the hunt for a fan grill switchboard or face
plate goes on.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/16/2004
- A
little
after midnight, the white ink on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch_On_RtP.jpg">right
panel</a> had dried, so <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel04.jpg">I
scraped off all traces of it</a> with a toothpick. I'm going to
give
myself
until I finish painting the fresh green and yellow <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron markers</a> on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons02.jpg">angle
irons</a> to find a better alternative to painting the white
pixels.
Otherwise,
I'm just going to have to apply the finishing coat without it. I'm
thinking
that some kind of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wite_Out.jpg">Wite-Out</a>
may do the trick, but only if I can find an appropriate applicator to
get
it onto my angle irons.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/15/2004
- I came
back
from <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a>
a little after 8PM today after a half hour walk. Pearl didn't have the <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Microns</a> in fresh green or yellow, but I was able to place an
order
for them, and according to the lady behind the counter, they should
arrive
at the store in a matter of days. After picking up a second black
Micron
05, I went to a counter at the back of the store, and asked the person
behind the counter if there was any such thing as a white fine point
permanent
marker. He gave me a white Pen-touch 1.0 marker, and said it would good
for writing on aluminum.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
A week ago, I
bought
a can of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Krylon_Acrylic.jpg">Krylon
Crystal Clear acrylic coating</a> at Pearl, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/RHC_-_Test_Pattern02.jpg">tested
it</a> on a scrap piece of aluminum. The acrylic didn't cause the
test
ink pattern to run or otherwise distort, and it protected the pattern
from
rubbing off. However, I could easily scratch off the acrylic, taking
bits
of the pattern with it. So here I was back at Pearl looking for an
alternative.
Taking the advice of the Customer Service person, I picked up a can of
Chartpak Clear Gloss Spray. All three items; the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a>, and the
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch1%28White%29.jpg">white
Pen-touch</a>, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Chartpak_Acrylic.jpg">Chartpak
spray</a>, cost me over $11.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I tested the
white
Pen-touch on the second aluminum scrap from the top hatch by trying to
draw a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch_On_LHC.jpg">small
square</a> in one of the corners. At first, I nothing came out of
the
pen,
but after considerable shaking and pressing in the retractable tip in
with
my finger, I was able to get it to work. The ink dried completely in
less
than an hour, and when it did, I tested its permanence by scraping it
with
my fingernail. The ink came off very easily, and if I wanted to, I
could
take off the mark while leaving very little residue.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Before I
trusted the
while pen on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons02.jpg">angle
irons</a>, I used it to draw the white area of the flames on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel04.jpg">right
panel</a>. The pen was twice as thick as the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">05
Microns</a>, and its round tip made it very hard to make
precision
marks.
I was afraid to do the corners completely and avoided them, so I
wouldn't
paint over the light green areas of the flames. I then tried a method
of
getting more precise marks by dipping a toothpick into the tip of the
pen,
and then using the toothpick as a writing instrument. However, I
couldn't
transfer ink from the toothpick to the panel. Furthermore, I think I
may
have damaged the pen's tip, because it started poking out farther than
it had before, and looked like it was ready to fall out of the pen.
This
made using it even more difficult. Then, the pen stopped writing and I
had to shake it again, and this to me was the final straw. I decided
not
to use the pen for my white pixels after all. I got as far as making <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pen-Touch_On_RtP.jpg">three
marks</a> on the panel, but decided that I would scrape off the
ink after it dried.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/14/2004
- Once
all
the black pixels of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2904.jpg">Coins</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2907.jpg">Koopa
Troopa</a> angle irons were painted, I allowed the black ink to
partially
dry while I purged the pictures of the <a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">camera</a>.
About 40 minutes later, I returned to the kitchen to continue
decorating
the angle irons. I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green
Pigma Micron</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2905.jpg">paint</a>
the green parts of the 3D block and the shadows of the coins on the
Coins
beam. As for the Koopa Troopa beam, I used green to paint the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2908.jpg">brick's
outline</a>, then the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2909.jpg">turtle's
shell</a>, eyes, and nostril, and finally <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2910.jpg">filling
in the green bricks</a>. I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM01%28Orange%29.jpg">orange
Micron</a> to draw the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2907.jpg">highlights</a>
on the coins. Sometime after midnight, I went upstairs to take a break
and soon my mother frantically called me back downstairs. When I got
back
to the kitchen, the coins angle iron was smudged, because my dad had
accidentally
brushed up against it. Fortunately, I was able to fix it in about half
an hour. After fixing a bit of smudging on the turtle's shell on the KT
beam, I just let both beams sit until around 6:30AM, which is when I
applied
the orange Micron to all orange areas of the beam; <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2914.jpg">the
face</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2915.jpg">the
feet</a>, and the quilted pattern on the shell. An hour later, I
felt
that
the ink on the beams was dry enough to remove the beams from the table,
so that's what did. I put them where the other two beams were; on the
high
chair next to the table, out of the way of anyone having breakfast this
morning. Once the ink is completely dry, I will wrap them each in a
sheet
of plastic, and put them back in the shoebox.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
When I
ordered the slimline
mounting rack yesterday, I was going to also order a yellow and a
fresh
green <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a>, but the shipping and handling fee was over ten bucks,
so I
thought, "fuck it, it's not worth it". Mom suggested that I go to <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a> and ask them to order the markers, so I can come back
when
they
arrive and pick them up. If I'm awake to do so, I'll see if I can stop
by Pearl today and make the orders. I'll also ask them if any white,
ultra
fine point permanent markers exist.</font> </p>

</center>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/13/2004
- It's
almost
2AM, and after a short break, I'm about to continue working on painting
my angle irons. I really wanted to get them finished yesterday, but I
once
again underestimated the scale of a task, and couldn't finish in a
timeframe
that I wanted to. It doesn't matter though; I just want to see this
thing
done one way or another. Then, I can focus on my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>
exams.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's almost
2:30AM,
and I FINALLY finished drawing the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Fourth_AI_Grid05.jpg">grid</a>
for my fourth and final angle iron. Drawing the guide dots on the right
edge of the angle iron was pretty straight forward; tape the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">aluminum
ruler</a> in place with tape on the right side, draw the dots on
the
left,
take the ruler off, put it back on with the tape on the left, and draw
the dots on the right. This time however, I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
pencil</a> the draw the dots instead of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a>. However, drawing the horizontal lines proved to be
more of
a challenge. I couldn't draw the lines with the aluminum ruler as the
edge,
because the left end of the ruler would bump into the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2914.jpg">Mario
angle iron</a> I had taped to the side of the table, four and a
half
inches
to the left of the angle iron I was drawing the grid on. So I went to
the
other side of the table, closed <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
and reached over it, and when I used the ruler as my edge this time,
the
ruler stuck out to my left, which was now away from the Mario angle
iron.
Using the interlacing method, I completed the horizontal lines of the
grid.
But when I crossed back over to the opposite side of the table, I
noticed
that the lines were leaning to one side. This is really no surprise,
since
the top and bottom edges are not exactly at right angles with the side
edges. I'm going to make this beam my Fire Flower beam, since it has
the
most blank space on the top and bottom of the other beams. This will
hopefully
make the slant less noticable.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After I
finished the
grid on my last angle iron, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI_On_Table01.jpg">moved</a>
it about eight and a half inches across the table to the right to give
myself some space to work on it, so my elbows wouldn't run into one
beam
as I worked on the other. Because the future Fire Flower beam was now
so
close to the end of the table, I didn't have anywhere to rest my arm
while
working on painting it. But I found it easier to work from the far end
of the table, and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Creamy_Painting_AI03.jpg">reach
across to the beam</a>. It was still an awkward position, since I
had
to
keep looking over my right shoulder to see Glamdring's screen in order
to follow the pattern on the gif.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
When I drew
the pattern
onto the Fire Flower beam, I started with black. I began by drawing the
top-most completely black row below the spent "?" block. This made the
crookedness of the grid even more obvious, but I was hoping that would
fix itself as I got furthur along. I then drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2901.jpg">four
bolts</a> of the spent "?" block, but they were one pixel too
high, so
I had to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2903.jpg">lower
them</a>. I then drew the all black row on top of the "?" block,
and
then
proceded to outline the flower from <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2904.jpg">bottom</a>
to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2908.jpg">top</a>.
Once I finished outlining the top of the flower, I then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2909.jpg">filled
in the black spaces</a> between the block and the stem, and
between the
stem and the oval part of the flower. Next, I filled in the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2910.jpg">blank
vertical spaces</a> on either side of the block with black. I
took a
short
break to move the pictures in the <a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">camera</a>
to </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox.jpg">Candybox</a></font><font size="-2">, and
then purge the
camera's pictures. When I got back to
the
kitchen, I blackened everything <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2911.jpg">below
the block</a> on the Fire Flower angle iron, and then everything <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2912.jpg">above
the flower</a>. I used a lot of black Micron ink filling in so
much
space,
and it's possible that I might need a new one to finish the rest of the
angle irons.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
With all of
the black
spaces on the Fire Flower beam filled, I focussed my attention again to
the Mario beam. Using the black Micron, I outlined the black parts of
the
3D block at the bottom of the beam, which were the bottom and right
sides
of the block. I then outlined the black on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2915.jpg">left
and right sides of Mario's legs</a>, and then outlined the black
area
between
his legs. My next stop was the outline of the face. Starting with the
two
black pixels just under the tip of the hat, I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2916.jpg">followed
the outline</a> of Mario's face down to his left arm. But when I
got
there,
I fell one pixel short the sleeve. At first, I thought I made a mistake
in the outline. But after extensive checking, I eventually realized
that
the spent "?" block at the top of the beam was positioned one pixel too
high. This was because I forgot that the angle irons were not exactly
four
inches high, but 1/16" taller than that. The space at the top was supposed to be
null, but I confused that for the top row of the beam when I based the
top block on it. Therefore, the block and everything I positioned based
on it was one pixel too high, which explained why I was falling one
pixel
short of the sleeves. I'm going to have to fix that before I get to
anything
else.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's almost
six-thirty
in the morning, and I've just finished moving the spent "?" block and
Mario's
hat <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2918.jpg">down
one row</a>. My next move on the beam is to continue outlining
the
black
spaces, but in order to give the red and green ink time to dry, I'm
going
to move on to the Fire Flower beam, and apply the orange and green to
it.
This should be a piece of cake now that the background is in, unless of
course I make any more major errors.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM01%28Orange%29.jpg">orange
Pigma Micron 01</a> for the first time, I filled in <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2913.jpg">the
center of the flower's oval</a>, and it went off without a hitch.
Using
an 01 pen feels a little different from using an 05; The finer tip made
me feel like I had a lot more leeway, and it made me feel more in
control
of what I was drawing. I then drew <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2914.jpg">the
inner outline</a> of the flower's stem and leaves with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green
Micron</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2915.jpg">filled
in the area</a> with green. It was at this point when I noticed
that
the
flower was one pixel too high above the block. But since it would be
WAY
too much of a bitch to correct at this point, and because it's not
really
that big a deal, I decided to let it slide. I finished with the green
by <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2916.jpg">outlining
the spent "?" with green</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Fire_Flower%2917.jpg">filling
in the block</a> completely.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Going back to
the
Mario beam, I drew the black outline of the face from the tip of the
hat
down, but kept going until I reached <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2919.jpg">the
bottom of the sleeve</a>. I then started the black outline at the
tip
of
the hat again, but this time I went in the other direction. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2920.jpg">outlined</a>
the rest of the hat, the back of the head, and then down to the bottom
of Mario's right sleeve. However, I did have a bit of a scare. I was
eating
pizza at the time, and the napkin I was holding must have brushed
against
the angle iron. As a result, there was a black streak that travelled
upwards
and to the right. As a stroke of incredible luck, most of the streaks
passed
through areas that were going to be black anyway. The only exceptions
were
the tip of the hat and a small streak through the "?" block. I already
fixed the "?", and already scratched off the tip of the hat, but I'm
going
to wait until the black is a bit drier before filling the red back in.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's after
8AM, and
I just finished applying the black ink to my Mario angle iron. I
outlined
the spent "?" block and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2921.jpg">inked
in the four bolts</a>. The bolts were not as easy as I would have
liked
them to have been, because their then blank spaces got a little blurred when I moved the
block
down one row. Then, finishing the black was only a matter of filling in
the black sections, one by one, from the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2922.jpg">top</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2925.jpg">down</a>.
I don't yet have a yellow Micron, so finishing the brown sections will
do it for the Mario angle iron for today. I'm going to bed now, and the
black ink on the beam should be dry by the time I get back to the
kitchen.
I just hope nobody smudges it while I'm gone; that would suck royally.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's almost
6:30PM,
and the Mario beam is now as completed as it's going to get today. I
finished
the brown coloring by first <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2926.jpg">outlining
the boots</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2927.jpg">working
up</a> to the&nbsp;<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2929.jpg">face and hair</a>, and then filling in the outlines starting with <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2930.jpg">the
eyes and the sideburns</a>, then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2932.jpg">working
down</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2933.jpg">the
boots</a>. After the brown ink dries, I'm going to remove the
beam from
the table and put it in a safe place.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;

Sometime
before 8:30PM,
I resumed work on my two remaining angle irons. I taped them both to
the
edge of the table on either side of my chair, making sure to keep the
bottom
of each image facing me. As before, I began with the black background.
I started on the Coins beam, outlining the 3D block on the bottom of
the
beam, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2902.jpg">the
two coins</a> above it. This completed the black outline of the
Coins
beam.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I then moved
right
on the Koopa Troopa beam. I marked the bottom black horizontal line of
the brick block, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2901.jpg">the
three uninterupted black lines</a> above it. I then drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2902.jpg">vertical
lines</a> to form the bricks. After that, I outlined and filled
in the
area under the mouth and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2903.jpg">three
black pixels</a> under the back of the shell. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2904.jpg">outlined</a>
the top of the shell and the top of the head, but this didn't go
flawlessly.
I drew the black space in the mouth one pixel too short, so I had to
fix
it and everything I based on it. Fortunately, this didn't give me too
much
of a problem. With the black outlines of the Coins and Koopa Troopa
beams
completed, I filled in the black areas. I did the the Coins beam first,
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2903.jpg">thickening
the outline of the coins</a> for some extra leeway, and then
filling in <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Coins%2904.jpg">the
rest of the black areas</a>. As for the Koopa Troopa beam, I
filled in <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2906.jpg">everything
above</a> the turtle with black, and then followed suit with <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Koopa_Troopa%2907.jpg">everything
below</a> the brick block.</font> </p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/12/2004
- I
didn't
get nearly as much work done as I would have liked to yesterday,
because
not only did my nephews Austin and Brandon show up, but my cousin Marie
also stopped by. The only thing I did manage to get done was draw the
15
vertical grid lines on one of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>. I began by <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid01.jpg">taping
the beam to the kitchen table</a> with three pieces of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a>; two on the side of the table, and one the top. I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">my
aluminum ruler</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a> to draw 15 guiding dots on the top and 15
on the
bottom. The ruler by itself was lower than the angle iron, so I used
one
of my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Cutouts01.jpg">top
hatch aluminum scraps</a> to bring the ruler up to the beam's
height.
Drawing
the 15 vertical lines was a bit tricky. I tried using my aluminum ruler
as an edge, but on a four inch beam, it kept wobbling. So I used a six
inch, plastic GTFM ruler instead. The tape holding the beam to the top
of the table was in the way of the lines, so to avoid running over it,
I removed it and put one piece of tape on either side of the beam on
the
top of the table. These new pieces hugged the edge of the table,
allowing
me to draw three or four lines on the other side of the beam. When the
lines reached the top pieces of tape, I peeled back the tape a little to
make room for more lines. When I reached the last few lines, I took the
tape off yet again, and put two new pieces over the lines I had already
drawn.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after 12:30AM
now, and I plan to finish drawing the grids for all four beams, and
then
fill in the grids with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">five
available Pigma Micron colors</a> I have so far. I'm going to get
this
done by next midnight, come hell or high water. I'm going to order the
slim
drive mounting rack from <a href="http://www.scsitray.com/" target="_top">MPI
Services</a>, and yellow and fresh green <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Microns</a>
from Gellyroll.com
today, and after the Microns get here, I will use them to fill in more
of the grids' squares on the angle irons.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after 5AM,
and I just finished the guiding grid of the first of four 4" angle
irons.
I would have gotten more work done if I didn't keep getting distracted
by doing random <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>
searches, so I'll try to cut down on the distractions and try to get at
least one more beam gridded by sunrise. Anyways, completing the
horizontal
lines was just as tricky as the vertical ones, if not more so. In order
to draw the guiding dots for these lines, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid04.jpg">I
taped the aluminum ruler to the wide edge</a> of the beam that
was
furthest
onto the table. Once again, I used the top hatch aluminum scrap to
raise
the ruler to the height of the angle iron. I put a piece of tape on the
left side of the beam, and one on the middle. After I drew all the dots
I could on the right edge, I put a new piece of tape on the right side
of the beam, covering the dots, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid05.jpg">removed</a>
the piece of tape on the middle of the beam. I then drew the dots in
the
middle of the beam, covered the dots with a middle piece of tape, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid06.jpg">removed
the left piece of tape</a>, and then drew the dots on the left.
This
way,
at least two pieces of tape always held the beam to the ruler.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
Because the
other
end of the beam was over the edge of the table, there was no table to
rest
the ruler on. So I put the ruler on top of the beam, with its inches
edge
against the vertical line closest to the edge of the table. I then put
two pieces of tape on the ruler, and followed the same pattern I did
when
I drew the dots on the opposite side of the beam; drawing <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid07.jpg">all
the dots I could</a> on the exposed parts of the beam, moving the
tape
when necessary and making sure that at least two pieces of tape were
always
on the beam, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid08.jpg">drawing
the rest of the dots</a>. Despite this method, the ruler was
still
loose
enough to move a little while taped down. I had a little trouble
getting
the lines straight, so I had to redraw some of them. Once the grid was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/First_AI_Grid10.jpg">finished</a>,
I untaped the beam from the table's edge.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I spent most
of these
morning's hours working on the guiding grids of my angle irons. I
completed
two more grids, the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Two_AI_Grids.jpg">second</a>
in about an hour 40, and the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Three_AI_Grids.jpg">third</a>
in just under an hour at around 7AM. At that time, everybody was coming
down to use the table for breakfast, so I had to put everything away
and
the fourth and final beam had to wait until later. I used a different
variation
of my method of gridding each time, and if I had the time or patience
to
get into the details, I would. But I don't, so I won't.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after 8:30PM
and I just drew the guiding dots for the grid on the top and bottom of
the fourth and final 4" beam. I used my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Pigma Micron</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Fourth_AI_Grid02.jpg">draw
the dots</a>, and I'm going to start working on painting the
other
beams
while I'm waiting for the dots to dry in order to save myself some
time.
Each angle iron is marked with <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI_-_Layout.jpg">a
T and a B</a>, standing for "top" and "bottom". I used these
marks
while
drawing the grids, so that the bottom row and left columns would be
exactly
1/16" wide. This is important, because the beams are not precisly 1" x
4"; they're off by about 1/16" on each dimension. Two of the beams have
T and B on the left side, and the other two have the letters on the
right.
This puts two grids on the left of the beams, and two on the right of
the
beams. The Mario and coins will be painted on the beams where the grid
is on the right side, and the Fire Flower and Koopa Troopa will be
painted
on the beams where the grid is on the left side. This way, Mario can be
on the left side looking at the Fire Flower on the right, and the Koopa
Troopa can be on the right side looking at the coins on the left.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
While waiting
for
the dots on the fourth angle iron to dry, I started working on the beam
with Mario. I taped the beam on table with three pieces of tape; two on
the side of the table on either side of the beam, and a third long
piece
on the very bottom. I also put two aditional pieces of tape over the
tape
on the sides vertically, to hold them in place tighter. I didn't want
to
put any tape on the beam on top of the table, since that would cover
the
grid.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I used <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
to bring up the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/Four_Beam_Collage.gif">gif
image</a> with the collage of the planned decorations of all four
beams,
and zoomed in 10:1 to expose the grid. Following the Mario beam's
design
on the far left end of the collage, I began applying ink to the beam,
with
the same method I used to paint the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel02.jpg">left
panel</a>. I would focus entirely on painting one color, let it
dry,
and
then move onto the next color. The 1/16" squares of these grids were
slightly
larger than the 1mm squares on the side panels, and I was hoping that
would
make my job a little easier.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I began with
the color
green, focusing on the spent "?" block on the top of the image. I <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2901.jpg">outlined
the four bolts</a> in the corners of the block, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2902.jpg">drew
the block's outline</a>, thickened the block's border and bolts'
borders
to 1/16", and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2903.jpg">filled
in the rest with green</a>. I next worked on the 3D block on the
bottom
of the beam. I began with the green pixel in the bottom right corrner,
then did <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2904.jpg">three
more</a>, in which I had to fill in the pixel one space up and to
the
left
of the previous pixel. I then drew the 8x8 pixel square to the top left
of the top left-most pixel of the four, and then drew <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2905.jpg">four
more pixels</a> in the same manner top left of the big square. I
then
thickened
the big square's border to 1/16", and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2906.jpg">filled
in the square</a> to finish the green in not only the block, but
the
whole
beam as well.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
By the time I
finished
the Mario beam's green, the dots on the fouth beam were dry. I changed
the position of the tape holding the ruler to the beam, and then drew
the
dots on the right side of the left edge of the beam. I couldn't draw
the
dots in the middle, because the piece of tape which held the beam to
the
top of the table was in the way. So I decided to let the ink dry again,
and then work on the beam's vertical lines. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Fourth_AI_Grid02.jpg">I
removed the aluminum ruler</a> from the beam, and then used the
GTFM
ruler
to draw the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Fourth_AI_Grid03.jpg">five
lines</a> closest to the edge of the table; the rest of the lines
were
blocked by the piece of tape holding the beam to the top of the table.
So I removed that peice of tape, but first used two other pieces to
reinforce
the pieces holding the beam to the side of the table. With the top of
the
beam cleared, I was then free to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Fourth_AI_Grid04.jpg">draw
the rest of the vertical lines</a>.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
The dots to
the right
of the gap were severely off center, so I fog-breathed and scratched
them
out with a paper towel. I then redrew the dots, and drew the dots in
the
middle of the left edge, this time without taping the ruler to the
beam;
I was confident that I could hold it in place long enough to finish the
dots, and I happened to get lucky. While letting the dots on the fourth
beam dry yet again, I decided to continue working on the Mario beam,
this
time with the red. Early on, I made a <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2907.jpg">misjudgement</a>
on the width of Mario's left leg (my right), and as a result, I had to
take a toothpick and <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2908.jpg">scratch
out some of the squares</a>. Mercifully, I didn't have to redraw
the
grid
this time, and only had to erase the red on three squares. After the
error
was <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2909.jpg">fixed</a>,
I successfully drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2910.jpg">outline
of Mario's red overalls</a>, drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2911.jpg">outline
of the yellow buttons</a>, and then<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2912.jpg">filled
in the red portions of the overalls</a>. I then drew the isolated
red
pixel
of the overalls, which was immediately to the top left of the rest of
the
overalls. Finally, I drew the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2913.jpg">outline
of the red portions of the hat</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI%28Mario%2914.jpg">filled
in the hat</a> to finish the red on the Mario beam.</font>

- About
11PM
last night, I began yet another session of painting my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name13.jpg">left
panel</a>. By this time, I had already drawn the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name14.jpg">black
outline</a> around the word "Creamy" and the left-hand quotes
using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a>. I started with the middle sections of the two "s"s in
"Goodness",
because that was the most difficult part of the word to outline without
drawing into the letters. After completing the rest of the outline of
the
"s"s, I proceeded to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name15.jpg">outline
the right-hand quotes</a>, and then the rest of the letters in
the word <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name17.jpg">except
for the letter "e"</a>. I did not outline this letter, because
the best
way to put the ink in the "dead end street" portion is to put my hand
very
close to the two "s"s I just painted. So I'm now waiting for all the
letters
to dry before doing the "e", so I don't risk smudging them.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
At around
1:30 this
morning, I had <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name18.jpg">outlined
the "e"</a> in "Goodness", and began outlining the final word on
my
left
panel: "Tenn". As always, I started with the most difficult sections,
and
then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name20.jpg">outlined
everything else</a> in the word. I'm currently letting the ink
dry, and
it should be dry enough to start filling in the rest of the background
by the time I finish typing the next parapraph.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
As I have
been working
on painting the left panel, specifically drawing the outlines of the
letters,
I've noticed that this is a very unforgiving part of the project,
because
I'm always one mistake away from ruining the entire panel. I'm just
hours
away from completing my side panels, if you ignore the second coat of
ink,
the acrylic coating, and the light green Micron ink that still has to
fill
the down arrow on the left panel. I'm very excited about almost getting
these panels done, and I kinda feel that I'm jinxing everything by
typing
this out. So I'm just going to not say anything else about them, at
least
not until I finish inking the left panel's background black.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after three,
and I've finished <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name21.jpg">blackening
out the background</a> on my left panel. The panel is now drying <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel02.jpg">uncovered</a>,
and I'm going to wait until daylight to wrap it in its protective
plastic
cover and put it away. I have now done all the work I can do on my side
panels without the light green Pigma Micron, so I have no choice but to
start decorating my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">four
inch angle irons</a>. I have <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">five</a>
of the eight colors of Pigma Micron necessary to finish the task; I
have
black, <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM01%28Orange%29.jpg">orange</a>,
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Red%29.jpg">red</a>,
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Brown%29.jpg">light
brown</a>, and
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">standard
green</a>, but I still need yellow, light green, and white. I'll
work
on
as much of the grid as I can today, and hopefully I can finish coloring
the beams in the five available colors by the 12th.</font>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">7/10/2004
- It's
5:30AM
right now, and about half an hour ago, I ran a few tests on the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/RHC_-_Test_Pattern02.jpg">aluminum
panel</a> which I'm using to test some <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Krylon_Acrylic.jpg">acrylic</a>
coating I bought recently at <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a>. First, in order to test how the acrylic would protect
the
ink
from rubbing off, I took an eraser and tried to erase a part of the
guiding
lines I drew in pencil. The mark stayed perfectly in-tact. I then tried
to erase both the Pigma and Sharpie test squares. They too remained in
tact. The next test I ran was to see if the acrylic could repel any
accidental
pen marks. So I took my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Red%29.jpg">red
Micron</a>, and my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Light_Green%29.jpg">bright
green Sharpie</a>, and marked two small vertical lines with each.
I
then
fogged the four marks with my breath, and then rubbed them with a paper
napkin. The Micron marks came off, but not the Sharpies. So I tried
scratching
them off with my fingernail, and fortunately they came right off. I
then
put the panel to the final test. I used the same two markers, and made
a horizontal mark across the test squares with each marker. Again, I
fogged
the lines, and rubbed them with the napkin, and only the Micron came
off.
However, when I scratched the Sharpie marks off, it took some of the
acrylic
with it, and part of the pencil guiding lines as well. This may be
because
the marks weren't completely dry; I could still smell a tiny bit of the
acrylic, and it was slightly sticky. I'm going to wait a few more
hours,
and then make another mark with the Sharpie, and try rubbing that off.
Even if the acrylic fails this test again, I'll still use it for CES's
panels, since it has proven to be able to prevent the ink from rubbing
off under most situations, and it repels some ink. This would make the
panels better off with the acrylic than without, since it would still
provide
them with some protection.</font> </p>

About a week
ago,
I found a cheaper alternative to the Slim CD-ROM / Floppy Disk Mounting
Kit I found on MyCableShop.com.
The MyCableShop mounting kit costs $58, and comes with a slimline to PC
floppy adapter, and a slimline to IDE adapter. The mounting
kit I more recently found from <a href="http://www.scsitray.com/" target="_top">MPI
Services</a> doesn't come with the adapters, but costs only $19.
I can
get the two adapters for $9.99 each on <a href="http://www.directron.com/" target="_top">Directron.com</a>,
which means if buy the MPI mounting kit plus the two adapters, I'd only
be paying $38.98 instead of $58, which saves me $19.02.</font>

I got rid of
the two
dark green pixels to the right of the word "SYSTEM" on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel03.jpg">right
panel</a> around 10PM. It was a simple matter of scratching out
the
green
pixels with a toothpick, using the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a> to draw the outline on the top and left edges, and
then <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel04.jpg">filling
in</a> the rest of the scratched out pixels with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Black%29.jpg">black
Sharpie</a>. The only thing left to do now is to wait until I get
the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name13.jpg">left
panel</a> and the
<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons01.jpg">four
4" angle irons</a> completely painted, and then cover everything
with
the
acrylic coating.</font> </p>

- In
order
to give the text on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name06.jpg">left
panel</a> a more <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/" target="_top">Legend
of Zelda</a>: <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=la" target="_top">Link's
Awakening</a> look, I have decided to add a down arrow to the
lower-right
corner to the text. Whenever a text box appears in LOZ:LA, a flashing
down
arrow on the bottom-right hand corner of the box appears when there is
more text to be read. I had the space to add such an arrow, but I
hadn't
drawn a grid in that section. Fortunately, all I had to do was draw
four
more vertical lines on the right side of the grid. So I used the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Pigma Micron</a> to make four dots on either side, and then used
them
to
draw the lines with my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">my
pink mechanical pencil</a>. Later on in the night, while I was
working
on the black background, I noticed that there was a fifth line, which
was
already part of the old 5mm square grid. It was still covered by the
piece
of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> which held the aluminum panel to its protective paper
cover,
so
using my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>, I stripped off that part of the tape. This time
however, I
did
not scratch the panel.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
While working
on painting
the black background of the left panel's text, I decided to play it
safe.
Instead of trying to cover every single bit of the panel with the black
Micron ink, I drew up to the grid lines which surrounded the green
pixels,
but did not risk crossing the lines and drawing into the green. Also, I
made sure that only one color of ink was wet at any given time in a
particular
area. This way, I could greatly reduce the chances of the colors smudging into each
other.
I followed a new pattern to paint the background; outline one word at a
time with black ink, and then use the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green
Micron</a> to fix any smudging in any other word, and then let
the ink
dry for about an hour. Then, I would come back and outline another word with
black,
fix smudging of the other words with green, and let the whole thing dry
again. I'd keep repeating this pattern until I was finished inking
the entire panel.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
I followed
this pattern
with "<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name07.jpg">CES</a>",
then "<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name08.jpg">built</a>",
then "<a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name09.jpg">by</a>",
then "Jason", and then the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name10.jpg">hyphen</a>
between "CES" and "built". Occasionally, I had to fix some smudging with
the letters I hadn't outlined yet, using a toothpick to erase wayward
ink,
and the green Micron to redraw any green squares that started to fade.
Some of the letters I had outlined had a little bit of black cutting
into
the green, so I had to wait for the errant letters to dry, scratch away
the offending black, and then redraw the square with the green Micron.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
When I
finished surrounding
all of the characters on the top row with black ink, I thought about
filling
the wide open spaces with the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Black%29.jpg">black
Sharpie</a>, just like I did with the right panel after I
finished
drawing
all of its letters. This seemed like a good idea, because the Microns
are
more expensive than the sharpies, and the ultra-fine point of the <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns02.jpg">Microns</a>
becomes a liability when covering a large area. However, black Sharpies
and black Pigma Microns do not produce the same shade of black, so I
decided
to <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name12.jpg">cover
the spaces with the Micron</a> for consistency.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
After taking
a break
to allow the large amount of Micron ink to dry, I brought up a mock
"All
your base..." screenshot of LOZ:LA to use as a guide to follow while
drawing
the down arrow. I would have just drawn the arrow itself, but because I
didn't yet have a Micron of a second shade of green, I could only draw
the black outline. The outline came out without a hitch, and it
immediately
gave the panel more of a Zelda feel. Because the arrow was on the right
edge of the panel, and "Creamy" was on the left edge, I decided it was
safe to outline the word without waiting for the arrow outline to dry. <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Name13.jpg">I
completed the outline</a> without any serious problems, and
because the
sun had already come up by then, I decided it was a good time to go to
bed then.</font> </p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's just
after 8AM,
and I just finished spraying the first coat of <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Krylon_Acrylic.jpg">acrylic</a>
coating on my <a href="http://creamyg.hugelaser.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/RHC_-_Test_Pattern01.jpg">test
panel</a>. I took the panel outside to the backyard and sprayed
it with
a thin coat of the acrylic, and left it outside because of the fumes,
but
I'll return soon to give it a second coat. So far, there seems to be no
signs of the ink running or bubbling, and I hope it stays that way.</font>
</p>
<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2">&gt;
It's after
10PM, and
I sprayed the test panel with a second coat of acrylic coating about an
hour ago. I've washed my hands thoroughly at least twice since then,
and
my hands still smell like the stuff. At the next sunrise, I will bring
the test panel inside, and then run a series of tests on it to see if
the
acrylic is good for CES's side panels. I'm going to take the rest of
the
day off from CES to work on my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font style="color: black;" size="-2">_</font><font size="-2"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+</a>
studies, so this will be the last paragraph I write for today.</font>
