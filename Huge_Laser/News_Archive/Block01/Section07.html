- Here's another late update in the series, effectively ending my "one
upgrade every four days" plan. But what matters is that it's here, so
who the hell cares? In this fifth upgrade of the series, I have updated
Oinkillune's character profile due to the information on the Deities
And Magic page. I've also eliminated Oinkillune's spoiler, since the
information it once contained will now be revealed at the beginning of
the story, and therefore will no longer ruin the plot. I don't know
when I'm going to finish the sixth and final upgrade, but I can give
you an idea of what to expect. First of all, this site will no longer
be known as the Infinite World Of Wonder, but something with fewer
syllables. I will introduce a new character to Evil Blood, and
eliminate one who longer has a clear purpose to the story. Also, the
entire site will undergo a total cosmetic makeover, making it easier to
navigate, and truer to the subject matters of each section. Finally,
there will be a new front-page mural, one that I've been designing for
many weeks, but haven't actually started drawing yet. There will be a
few other changes as well, but they're too many to list here, so I
guess I have no choice but to leave you all to wonder. Muahahahaha!</font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- Due to certain distractions in my real life, I was forced to skip the
upgrade for the 16th. Anyways, this is still considered to be the forth
upgrade in this series, and a rather significant one at that. All of
the upgrades tonight are in the Evil Blood section of IWOW. There is a
new Glossary page, which should make my job of explaining the different
elements of Evil Blood a little easier. While it only has five entries
for now, you can bet your ass that number will skyrocket in the future
as I continue to develop the story. I feel it's worth noting that the
Glossary page is the first time I ever used targets in HTML. I also had
a chance to finish updating the Zodian Threat page, which happened to
be a near complete overhaul. Finally, there are a multitude of story
fixes on the recently updated pages. That's all for now, take it easy.</font></small></font></small><small style="color: white;"><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

page, which stores all of the front page murals I've put up in the
past. In the Evil Blood section of IWOW, I have begun the process of
breaking the former Plot page into two separate pages, as well as
updating the story in the process. A short description of the primary
human threat to Nnet Olotor is described in the new Alien Invasion
page. The story behind the threat that Zod poses to Nnet Olotor had not
yet been updated, but it can be found in its own section, The Zodian
Threat.</font></small></font></small><small style="color: white;"><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- I LIVE!!! It's been over FIVE months since I last updated IWOW, but
let's not dwell on the past, shall we? I've had so much work building
up all this time, that I decided it would be best if I broke it
up into several small updates. Within the next 20 days, I plan to make
one additional update at four day intervals. As the first contribution
of this series of updates, I have created a new sub-section of Evil
Blood by the name of Deities And Magic, which explains the origins of
magic and deities on Nnet Olotor, and the connection between the two. I
also wrote the first sub-section of D&amp;M, which is Mages And
Clerics. I know a lot of you have had trouble navigating through this
site, but by the time these updates are through, getting around IWOW
should be a lot easier. I also plan on changing the look of the site,
and am even considering a possible name change. That's all for now, and
if all goes well, I should have IWOW updated again on the eighth.</font></small></font></small><small><small>

- WTF??? It's really been over four frickin' months since my last
update? Yeah, well better late then never, huh? Anyways, I finished
three major updates to Evil Blood's story. The first of these updates
is the first spoiler of Evil Blood's basic plot. This was a
particularly frustrating experience, because once I had everything
written out, I lost it all when transferring the text via clipboard. I
made the stupid mistake of copying something else to the clipboard
before my transfer was finished. It took me two hours of non-stop
typing to get it all back, and I don't feel it turned out nearly as
good as the first time. :( The second update is a more detailed
description of Oinkillune, although this sure as hell isn't its final
version. The third update is the start of a complete overhaul of Dust's
character. These are only about half the updates I had in mind for
IWOW, so expect more within the next couple days. <a href="mailto:jrascot@hotmail.com">Rascot</a> out.</font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- I have made a few alterations in the process of creating the design
of my characters. You can read all about it in the Characters page of
the Evil Blood section. In case you didn't notice already, I changed
the background of this page, and have decided to cycle through some of
the other backgrounds I've put up in the past, as well as putting up a
few new ones. I've also gotten IWOW's birthday mural finished. So what
if it's nine days late, it's up now so who the hell cares?</font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- Today, my online baby, The Infinite World Of Wonder, reaches its
second birthday! I'm sorry I don't have a mural yet, but I'll try to
whip one up tomorrow. :( Anyways, the "Kissing The Public's Ass" poll
is now officially closed, and the winner is Dib with 20 votes. Keep in
mind, however, that I can't guarantee that I'll ever get this model
completed, as I don't have a crystall ball to tell me what obstacles
life will throw at me. As for any real site updates, some critical
changes have been made to the Follycount section as I suggested five
days ago. It's too much to explain on this page so head on down there
to see for yourself. Also, Stardancer's height and details pic is now
available for you to see in the Evil Blood section.</font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- I must humbly apologize for the lack of updates, and for a near two
month wait, I don't have much to show for it. :( The only thing I
really did was fix a broken link on this page. But now for something
important for the site's regular visitors. The Infinite World Of
Wonder's second anniversary is coming up in five days on the second of
October. On that day, I will officially close the "Kissing The Public's
Ass" poll and announce its winner. So if you haven't yet voted for who
you want to see in the arenas, do it soon. Also, expect a few changes
to the Follycount section of the site.</font></small></font></small><small><font size="+1"><small><font size="-2"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"></span></font></small></font></small></p>

- Well, do I have an update for you tonight. I made a rather significant
update to the Basic Plot page of IWOW's Evil Blood section. I've also
taken the liberty of fixing all&nbsp; the banners on the site, as well as
brightening the dark purple color of the old news, just to make things
easier on your eyes. I was hoping to have the height and details pic
and the turnaround of Stardancer finished by this update, but time
restrictions got in the way. :( Oh well, maybe next time.</span></small></small></p>
