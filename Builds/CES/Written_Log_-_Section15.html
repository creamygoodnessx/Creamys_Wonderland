- Over the past few days, I've been
adjusting the budget of the Creamy Entertainment System. Since the last
time I announced the budget, the 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM </font><font size="-2">from&nbsp;</font><a href="http://www.pqi.com.tw/" target="_top"><font size="-2"><font size="-2"></font></font></a><font size="-2"><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.pqigroup.com/" target="_top">pqi</a></font></font><font size="-2"> that then cost $80.56</font><font size="-2"> on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a> has dropped
in price to less than $70. In addition to the RAM from pqi, I also have
two other 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM modules bookmarked from NewEgg, on</font><font size="-2">e from </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.vikingcomponents.com/" target="_top">Viking
Components</a></font><font size="-2">, an</font><font size="-2">d the other from </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.allcomponents.com/site/index.shtml" target="_top">All
Components</a></font><font size="-2">. The
Viking
RAM is the most expensive of the three, costing $72.00, while the </font><font size="-2">All Components</font><font size="-2">
RAM, like the one from pqi,
is less than $70. I'm going to put the Viking RAM on the
budget even though it's currently the most expensive module. This is
because RAM has a nasty habit of going up in price unexpectedly, and
I'm trying to give myself a little leeway.<br>
<br>
&gt; Instead of getting a 512MB PC2100 DDR RAM module from pqi for
$80.56, I'm now getting one from </font><font size="-2">Viking

2</a></font><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;"></span></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2"> so
I could show them the <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/gc/games/simpsons-hit-and-run/27731" target="_top">Simpsons:
Hit &amp; Run</a> game. I also brought along
CES and all of its parts. I explained to JD my plan to mount <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a> and drives to CES. When I mentioned how I planned on
mounting
the reset button, he suggested I use a special drill bit called a
unibit. It wasn't until later in the night that I understood that a
unibit is a cone shaped drill bit, just like <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Unibit.jpg">the
one that Peter used</a> to
make the drill holes for CES. JD didn't have such a bit handy, but he
suggested that he could pick one up at the local hardware store the
next day after work, and then pick me up so we could work on CES. It's
just after 1PM, and JD said that he gets off from work at around 4PM,
so I still have some time to make a few final preparations. <br>
<br>
&gt; At around 3:30PM, JD stopped by at my house and picked me up.
I
took along CES and all of its parts, but this time around I left the
Playstation 2 at home. We stopped by a hardware store in town and
bought a cone-shaped drill bit, also known as a unibit. The unibit cost
nearly forty bucks, so JD and I had to split the cost 50/50. After we
arrived at JD's house, he began preparing a spaghetti and meatball
dinner, while I took a rest on the couch and played with my nephew
Austin. After watching a couple episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Garage" target="_top">Monster
Garage</a>, we went to
the basement to begin work on CES. JD examined the chassis, and then I
removed the top-front 12" angle iron to make the job easier. He then
used a standard drill bit to make a hole directly in the center of the
reset button mark on the beam. He then opened the unibit's packaging,
and I touched the bit for a second and noticed that it was covered in
grease. JD switched to the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/JD%27s_Unibit.jpg">unibit</a>,
and drilled a few notches down, and
then checked the size of the hole by putting the reset button into it.
The hole was too small, so he drilled another notch down on the unibit.
He kept repeating the pattern until the hole was just the right size.
As it turns out, I had marked the hole precisely in the right spot; any
higher, and the unibit would have run into the horizontal side of the
angle iron, any lower, and the hole would have gone over the vertical
side's edge, resulting in an incomplete circle for a hole.<br>
<br>
&gt; JD and I took a break to have dinner, and then returned to the
basement to finish the job. JD mentioned that he could use something
called a threading kit to fit the reset button's bolt hole firmly into
place. A threading tool can allow a bolt to screw into place tightly
like a wood screw. He said that the worst thing that could happen was
that he could drill the hole too big, but he could then pop out the
threading, and then fit the bolt in place with a nut the other end. I
agreed to go the threading route, and soon JD was searching for his
threading kit. It took him a while to find it, but once he did, he
proceeded to make a test hole on a scrap yardstick-like piece of
aluminum. I thought that one of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/8-32x1-2_Brass_Angled_Bolts.jpg">angle-headed
8/32" bolts</a> that I
used to fit the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Hinges.jpg">hinges</a>
onto my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a> would suffice, but the
fit in the reset button's bolt hole was terrible. JD found a steel bolt
that was slightly narrower than one of my 8/32" bolts, and the head was
the right shape to fit into the hole. JD drilled a hole in the test
aluminum piece with one of the smaller drill bits, but the hole was too
small, so he used the next biggest bit. He threaded the hole, but the
hole was too big for the bolt, causing the bolt to wobble. We then
tried one my own flat-bottom bolts, and it was a much better fit.<br>
<br>
&gt; With the size of the reset button's bolt hole established, and
with the fitting bolt picked out, JD proceeded to work on the real hole
on the 12" angle iron. He carefully rotated the reset button, so that
its bolt hole lined up with the horizontal mark. The button was
somewhat unstable, so he had to hold it firmly in position while
drilling the hole. He drilled partially into the beam, and the hole
appeared to be perfectly centered on the line. JD then removed the
button to prevent it from being damaged, drilled through
the hole the rest of the way, and then used the threading tool to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Holes.jpg">thread
the hole</a>. I tried out the holes in the angle iron
to confirm that the reset button and its bolt could fit them. I fed the
button wire
end first into the hole, and the button's body fit snugly into place.
Then, I lined up the button's bolt hole with the corresponding hole in
the
angle iron, and started to bolt it in place. JD warned me that
over-tightening the bolt could damage the threading, so I screwed the
bolt on just tight enough to get a snug fit. Although it probably
wasn't
necessary, I fitted a nut onto the other side of the bolt just to make
sure the button stayed on. Satisfied with the fit and done for the day,
I bolted the angle iron back to the front of the chassis, and put
everything away. JD was kind enough to let me borrow his <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Hobby_Saw.jpg">hobby
saw</a>, and
once I was packed up, I got a ride home from my dad who came to pick me
up.</font> </font></p>

chassis the way it is. This way, I can undersize the hole when I drill
it, and then make it bigger gradually until it's exactly the right size.</font><br>

<font size="-2">&gt; Earlier this afternoon, I wanted
to find out exactly where the
slimline mounting rack will end up within CES. Because I knew the reset
button's exact position, I in turn knew the front panel's exact
position. I laid CES on its back end, carefully put the panel in place,
and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Positioning03.jpg">temporarily
attached it</a> to the front of the chassis with masking
tape. Then, I used my </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a></font><font size="-2">
to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/SDR_-_AI%2812TF%29_Marks01.jpg">make
a mark</a> through <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_CDD_Bay.jpg">the
hole</a> I cut out for the slimline CD drive. But then, I
couldn't
figure
out what to do next. The old CD drive hole told me where I could place
the mounting rack, but I still had no idea how to put the rack into
position to mark the holes on the bottom panel. So I decided to take
the panel off until I could get a better idea of what the hell I was
doing. </font><br>
<font size="-2"> </font><br>
<font size="-2">&gt; However, before I removed the
panel, I put my homemade medicine
bottle power button <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/PwB_Panel_-_Test01.jpg">into
the panel's green bottle top</a>, in order to get
an idea of how to attach it permanently to the chassis. Somehow, the
button <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/PwB_Panel_-_Test02.jpg">stuck
to the back of the bottle top</a> on its own. After studying the
back
of
the button for about a minute, I figured out how to put it permanently
into place. The back of the button (the bottom of the medicine bottle)
was almost in line with the front 12" angle irons' inner-most edges. I
believe that I can fix the button in place by bolting the horizontal
end of a thin angle iron to the bottom of the top-front 12" beam. The
vertical end would point downward, and extend about an inch and a half.
On the inner edge of the vertical end of the thin angle iron, I would
attach the back of the power button. There is a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Copper_Spring.jpg">big
copper spring</a>
inside the button, allowing me to put a tiny screw through the back of
the button and inside the spring. This is the only way I can get a
screw in there without it getting in the way of the spring. After I was
satisfied with where I was planning to put the power button, I took off
the front panel and erased the drive rack mark on the chassis.</font><br>
<font size="-2"> </font><br>
<font size="-2">&gt; As I typed out the above
paragraph, I came up with another method
of determining the correct position of the slimline mounting rack.
Since the
rack's position inside the chassis is not as important as that of the
reset button, I felt that I could cut the hole for the rack in my front
panel before bolting the rack to the bottom panel. I knew how far left
and right the rack would be (Along the right edge of the front panel),
and how far into the chassis it would go (rack's faceplate the same
depth as the front panel), but I hadn't yet determined how high off the
bottom panel it would be. If I put it too high, it would run into the
top-front 12" angle iron. Too low, and it would clash with the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hard_Drive01.jpg">hard
drive</a>. My plan was to cut the existing slimline CD drive hole
bigger to
fit the rack's faceplate. The first thing I did was determine the
height of the bottom of the front panel compared to the bottom panel. I
put the front panel into position and held it there with my hand. I
could see a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BmP_Through_Chassis.jpg">little
piece of the bottom panel</a> from under the front-left
4" angle iron, and so I was able to compare its height to the bottom of
the front panel. They appeared to be very close in height, but the
front panel looked to be very slightly higher. </font><br>
<font size="-2"> </font><br>
<font size="-2">&gt; The next step was to take a few
measurements to find out how much
space there was between the hard drive and the horizontal edge of the
top-front 12" angle iron. I decided that the best way to do this was to
first put a mounting rack faceplate on the front panel where I felt the
rack would go. Instead of using the beige faceplate already on the
mounting rack, I felt it was easier to use the detached black
faceplate instead. I placed the plate <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/SDR_-_Positioning01.jpg">face
down</a> against the front
panel's right edge, and made sure the top of the plate ran along the CD
bay hole. That position looked good, so I decided to go with it and get
on with the measurements. I used my </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">aluminum
ruler</a></font><font size="-2">
to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/SDR_Faceplate_-_Measurement01.jpg">measure
the
height of the faceplate</a>, which turned out to be about 42
millimeters. I then retrieved the empty brass <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_-_Mount.jpg">hard
drive cooling
mount</a> and my
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive.jpg">broken
Maxtor hard drive</a> from my bedroom, <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HdD_On_HDC01.jpg">put
the two
together</a> the same way I plan to put together the real drive
and
cooler,
and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/HdD&amp;HDC_-_Measurement.jpg">measured
their combined height</a>, which was just over 40 millimeters.
Then, with the faceplate still in position, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/SDR_Faceplate_-_Measurement02.jpg">measured
the distance</a>
between the bottom of the panel and the bottom of the faceplate, which
was about 45 millimeters. Since the height of the drive plus the cooler
was only 40mm, there will be only 5mm separating the bottom of the
slimline mounting rack and the top of the hard drive. In order to get a
visual sense of what this will look like, I put the empty drive cooler
on top of the broken hard drive, stood the front panel up against the
drive and cooler, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Drive_Positioning04.jpg">manually
held</a> the slimline drive rack
faceplate in its place on the panel. Despite the closeness of the
components, I
think it will all fit just fine.</font><br>
<font size="-2"> </font><br>
<font size="-2">&gt; Tomorrow, I plan to cut the
rectangular hole for the mounting rack
in the front panel. I will undersize it so I can make adjustments if
necessary. If it turns out that the hole will be too low, I can cut the
space above it and vice versa. This is the first irreversible step that
I've done to the panel in a long time so I'm very nervous about doing
it. Once the
hole has been cut, I will then determine exactly how to mount the rack
inside the chassis, as well as the hard drive itself.</font> </font></p>

<p style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><font size="-2"><font size="-2">
11/15/2004 - When I recently studied how
the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font size="-2">
would fit onto CES's chassis, I noticed that the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font><font size="-2">
would probably be slightly too high to fit behind the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Hole_OK.jpg">hole</a>
in the
panel. I soon realized that the margin of error of the placement of the
reset button is much slimmer than any other component on the front
panel. The button will be fitted to the top-front 12" angle iron, but
since the beam is only 1" wide, there's not a lot of places the button
can go. If the button is too high, I will be forced to cut the
horizontal side of the beam to make room for it. It the button is too
low, part of the hole for the button will pass below the vertical side
of the beam. On the other hand, the other front panel components, such
as the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button04.jpg">power
button</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">slimline
drive rack</a>, have a lot of places they
can go, and their positions are less dependent to whatever they're
anchored to. It's for this reason that I've decided to fit the reset
button into place before the other front panel components. <br>
<br>
&gt; I already know the horizontal position of the front panel; <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Positioning01.jpg">right
smack in the middle</a> of the front of the chassis. I also know
the
reset
button's vertical position; As high on the top 12" beam as it will go
without clashing with the beam's horizontal side. Determining the exact
positions of both the button and panel will just be a matter of putting
the panel exactly in the middle of the front of the chassis, marking
the button's horizontal position through the panel's reset button hole,
removing the panel, moving the button to its vertical position, and
then marking that position. Several months ago, I made a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate05.jpg">cardboard
simulation</a> to help myself determine the positions of the
power and
reset buttons, and the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">power
and HDD LEDs</a>, so I could make a single
mount for all of them. The simulation had two holes for the reset
button; a big hole for the button itself to fit through, and a nearby
smaller hole for the fastening bolt. Two days ago, I put the front
panel where I felt it should go on the chassis, and used my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a> to make a rectangular
mark<span style="color: black;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark01.jpg">through
the panel's reset
button hole</a>. Using that <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark02.jpg">reset button mark</a> as a guide, I will
copy
the
hole pattern to the 12" angle iron. When I get a chance, I will use
either Peter's or </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font><font size="-2">'s drill press to drill the
two holes, and then fit
the button into position.<br>
<br>
&gt; This morning, I got to work on marking the position of where
the
reset button is going to go the chassis. I did all of today's work with
the chassis resting on its back end, so that the front end faced
upwards. My first concern was to figure out the horizontal position of
the button. This wasn't too hard to figure out; all I had to do was
place the front panel in the middle of the front of the chassis. The
rectangular mark on the chassis lined up with the reset button
hole, so I removed the panel, and&nbsp;</font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2">used my pink&nbsp;pencil to</font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2"> draw a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark03.jpg">vertical
line</a> through the
middle of the mark. With the horizontal position marked, my next
concern was to figure out the reset button's vertical position, but
this was a lot trickier. When I drill the reset button hole in the
vertical side of the chassis' top-front 12" angle iron, the hole has to
be clear of the angle iron's horizontal side. So I retrieved my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler.jpg">aluminum
ruler</a> from my bedroom, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/AI_-_Thickness_Measurement.jpg">measured
the thickness</a> of one of
CES's angle irons, which turned out to be about three millimeters. So I
drew several dots along the top-front 12" beam, each three millimeters
from the top edge, and then used the ruler's edge to bridge the dots while I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Height_Limit_Mark.jpg">connected
the dots</a>
with a single line. This line was to mark how far up the reset button
could go without running into the horizontal edge of the beam.<br>
<br>
&gt; Next, I placed the reset button <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Measuring_With_RsB.jpg">face
down</a>
on the vertical edge of
the 12" beam, with one of its edges running along the horizontal line,
with the button's bolt hole on the right side. I used my pink pencil to
mark the
outline of the hole. I then used the same method to mark <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark04.jpg">a
few more
bolt hole marks</a> across the angle iron. I laid the ruler on
top of
the
4" beams on either side of the 12" beam, and began to draw a horizontal
line across the circular marks. But before I could finish the line, I
realized that the marks were uneven, so I stopped and erased the
partially drawn line and
the marks. I then tried a different method of determining the vertical
position of the reset button. I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB02_-_Half_Width_Measurement.jpg">measured
the distance</a> between the
middle of the reset button and its right edge, which turned out to be
10 millimeters. So I made a few marks on the 12" beam, each exactly 10
millimeters from the horizontal line that marked the inner edge of the beam's
horizontal side, and then used my pink pencil to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark05.jpg">connect
the dots</a>.<br>
<br>
&gt; Once the horizontal line was drawn, that line, along with the
vertical line I drew earlier, formed a cross, and told me where the best
position to put the reset button was. This position was a little lower than
the center of the old rectangular reset button mark, which meant that
the front panel would have to sit lower than I originally planned it
to. To remove any future confusion, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark06.jpg">erased
the rectangle</a>, leaving
only the cross. The next step was to place the cardboard button hole simulation
over the plus to draw the button's drill hole. In order to make this
task a little easier, I marked <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark07.jpg">five
and ten millimeter marks</a> from the
center of the plus, making the plus look like crosshairs. But the reset
button holes in the cardboard simulation were too far away from the
sides of the sheet to put directly over the hole, because the left 4"
angle iron was in the way. So I put the left side of the simulation on
top of the 4" beam, and looked for something to rest the right side of
the sheet on. I eventually came across a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Speaker_Part.jpg">part
of an old speaker</a>, rested
that on top of the chassis, and rested the cardboard sheet on top of the speaker part and
the left 4" beam. I put the sheet's big hole <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Mark_Through_Sim.jpg">over
the plus sign</a> on the
chassis, with the small hole to the right of the big one, and directly
over the horizontal line. The speaker piece kept sliding as I was
getting ready to make the marks, so I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Speaker_Part_-_Taped.jpg">taped
it to the chassis</a>,
afterwhich it held solidly in place. After I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark08.jpg">marked
the two holes</a> in
the chassis, I removed the speaker piece from the chassis, but when I
did that, the small hole mark <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Bolt_Mark_Removed.jpg">came
off with the tape</a> that was holding
the speaker piece in place.<br>
<br>
&gt; I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Positioning02.jpg">put
the front panel back into place</a>, but this time I lowered it
slightly to accommodate the reset button's new position. The bottom of
the panel was no longer running along the bottom edges of the 4" beams,
but was now slightly below them. The panel's horizontal position was
exactly in the middle of the chassis, and the plus sign on the chassis
was <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark09.jpg">exactly
centered</a> behind the reset button hole in the panel.
However, when I removed the panel, I noticed that the big circle was
not centered around the plus sign. So I erased the circle, and decided
to try a new method of drawing it. I measured the width of the big hole
in the simulation, which turned out to be about 17 millimeters across.
Half of 17 is eight and a half, so using my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Pigma Micron pen</a>, I
drew four dots on the plus sign, each exactly eight and a half
millimeters from the center. I also used the Micron to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RsB_Chassis_Mark10.jpg">thicken
the
center of the plus</a>. I decided that drawing another circle was
not
necessary, and neither was replacing the small hole mark that came off
with the speaker piece. The Micron marks could tell the drill bit where to go
just fine, so I left it like that.</font> </font></p>

11/14/2004 - For the past few days, I was
planning
on making a pair of keyhole-shaped holes in CES's front 4" angle irons,
and attach corresponding pegs in the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font size="-2">
so I can slide the
panel downwards into place. The panel could then be fastened on by a
single thumbscrew. Today, I realized that this option of attaching the
panel would not be possible. This is because the face of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">slimline
mounting rack</a> would stick through its slot in the panel, and
would
not
let the panel slide into place. The only way to get the front panel on the
chassis is to push it straight forward, and somehow fasten it into
place. As of right now, my plan of attaching the panel is to simply fit
it into place, and lock it in with a single thumbscrew in the
bottom-middle of the panel that will go through the panel's <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Indent.jpg">rectangular
notch</a>. If
this notch ends up completely above the bottom 12" angle iron, I can
attach a small piece of aluminum to the angle iron behind the notch, so
I can fit on a thumbscrew. By the time CES is completely finished, it
will have not only the drive rack sticking through it, but also the
faceplate for the PS/2 and USB ports. These two things should keep the
panel from shifting and turning, but it still may not be enough to keep
the panel still, even with the thumbscrew. If it's not, I may have to
add more thumbscrews. <br>
<br>
&gt; I was studying the front panel again just now, and I noticed
two
tiny notches on the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the frame.
If I do decide to go with more thumbscrews, I may place one screw
through each of these two notches. The 4" beams will be just behind the
notches, so I won't have to make any special attachments to the chassis
to put thumbscrews into those notches.</font> </font></p>

11/13/2004 - Three days ago, I was working
on
transplanting hardware components from <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RayCarmen_-_Empty_Chassis.jpg">Ray_Carmen</a>,
my parents' old
computer, and into <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>,
the computer I got from my </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+
Certification</a></font><font size="-2">
course at <a href="http://www.fdu.edu/" target="_top">Fairleigh
Dickinson University</a>. Ray_Carmen's
motherboard was fried, and Polyfragger lacked hard drives, so I felt
that the logical thing to do was to merge the two machines together.
Now, Ray_Carmen's drives and expansion cards are combined with
Polyfragger's chassis, motherboard, and power supply. Since this new
machine is the cross between Polyfragger and Ray_Carmen, I am now
calling it <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/PolyCarmen.jpg">PolyCarmen</a>.<br>
<br>
&gt; Anyways, as I was finishing the merger, and closing up
Ray_Carmen's old and empty chassis, I noticed that I didn't need a
screwdriver or conventional screws to close <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RayCarmen_-_Side_Panel.jpg">one
of the side panels</a>.
Instead, there were <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RayCarmen_-_Sliding_Notches.jpg">three
slits</a> on the side of the chassis on the top,
and three on the bottom. The panel had corresponding tabs that fit into
the holes, and I could close it by placing it against the chassis, and
then sliding it to one side. The panel also had a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RayCarmen_-_Thumbscrew.jpg">thumbscrew</a>
permanently attached to it, and this locked the panel into place. I
began to think that I could implement something similar to CES's </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font size="-2">.
I'm typing this out on <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
in the kitchen, and I have
CES's chassis in front of me. I've been spending the past few hours
studying the chassis and the plastic front panel, trying to figure out
how to attach the two together. I noticed a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Indent.jpg">small
rectangular
indentation</a> in the front of the panel, centered and towards
the
bottom.
I figured this notch would be a good place to put a thumbscrew, should
I decide to go with that option. However, a single thumbscrew will not be enough to hold the front panel
securely in place. Right now, the only thing I can think of is making
keyhole-shaped holes in the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons06.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>, and corresponding pegs in
the panel. But there may be many options I haven't thought of yet, so
hopefully something will pop into me soon.<br>
<br>
&gt; I've noticed a few other things&nbsp;while studdying the
front
panel. With CES's chassis resting on its back end, I placed the panel
so that it was <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/FrP_-_Positioning01.jpg">horizontally
centered</a> on the 4" beams, and that the
bottom of the panel rested along the bottom of the beams. The left
4" beam is slightly higher than the one on the right, but the front
panel is crooked in the same way, so the two imperfections cancel each
other out. While the front panel was in place, I noticed that the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Hole_OK.jpg">hole</a>
for the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a> was very high on the top 12" beam, and that this
could force the top side of the button over the top of the 12"
beam. When I get the chance, I'll measure the button to see how high it
can go, and if the reset button hole on the front panel lines up with
it. But for now, I'm going to hit the sack, since it's after 7AM and
I've been up all night.</font> </font></p>

11/1/2004 - Just after 11PM last night, I
began to
reassemble CES's chassis, a task that extended into the next day. I
retrieved the top and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Bottom_Assembly02.jpg">bottom</a>
assemblies, and the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Back_Panel02.jpg">back
panel</a> of CES from
my bedroom, and laid them out on the kitchen table. I then bolted
together the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Left_Assembly02.jpg">left</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Right_Assembly01.jpg">right</a>
assemblies. I knew that putting the panels
on the right way may be tricky, because Peter and I had drilled the
holes for the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels08.jpg">left
and right panels</a> to be reversed. Some of the holes
may not line up to let the bolts through, and there was the possibility
of me having to drill new holes.<br>
<br>
&gt; I began by attaching the right assembly to the right side of
the
bottom assembly. The bottom-left bolt attached the two assemblies
together OK, but it was when I tried to put the bottom-right bolt in
place that I started having problems. I fit a bolt through the panels
successfully and thought everything was OK, but I soon realized the
right assembly was <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RtA_-_Uneven01.jpg">crooked</a>
and had to be fixed. So I went to the
basement pantry and retrieved my dad's <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Panasonic_Drill.jpg">Panasonic
hand drill</a>, and a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Drill_Bits02.jpg">box
of 20 drill bits</a>. I changed to the 11/64" drill bit, and held
the
right
assembly so it was as parallel to the table as I could get it. I put
the drill bit through the hole at the bottom of the Fire Flower angle
iron and tried to drill through the bottom 7" right-side beam, but I
couldn't keep the chassis still. So I called my mother to hold the
chassis while I drilled the hole. I was able to successfully <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/RtA_-_Corrective_Hole.jpg">make
the
hole</a>, and the right assembly was fairly even. But it was late
at
night
and my mother had to go to bed, so I had to look for other ways to hold
down the chassis while I drilled.<br>
<br>
&gt; Next up was attaching the left assembly to its place on the
bottom assembly, but this turned out to be even more of a bitch than
the right side. After bolting the bottom-left corner of the left
assembly to the bottom assembly, I lifted up the right side of the left
assembly so it was as close to parallel to the table as I could get it,
and used <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/LtA_-_Taped.jpg">hold
it in place</a>. I then grabbed a deck of blue <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Bicycle_Cards.jpg">Bicycle
playing cards</a> from a nearby drawer, made a stack at the
height
of the left side of the left assembly, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/LtA_-_Cards01.jpg">slid
the stack under the
right side</a>. I taped the stack together so the cards wouldn't
fly
apart.
There was already a drill hole on the front side of the Koopa Troopa
angle iron, but the matching hole in the bottom-front 12" beam didn't
match it exactly, so I fixed that with the drill. I then put a bolt
though the hole, and secured it with a nut. This made the chassis more
stable a I drilled the hole in the 7" left-side angle iron through the
painted-side bottom hole in the Fire Flower beam. I then put in a bolt
and secured it with a nut, and the side panels were finally <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Chassis_Reconstruction01.jpg">secured
to
the proper positions</a>. Luckily, I managed to keep the left
assembly
fairly parallel to the table.<br>
<br>
&gt; The next step was to fit on the top assembly, and when it <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Chassis_Reconstruction02.jpg">bolted
on</a> without me having to drill any new holes, I was overjoyed,
and I
thought I was nearing the end of the re-assembly of CES. However, I
still had to put on the back panel. There were bolt holes already on
the top of the back side of the back 4" angle irons, but I couldn't use
them because any bolt going though those holes would run into other
bolts in the area. So I drilled a new hole in the top-left corner of
the back of CES just to the right of the old one, but as soon as I
pulled the drill out of the hole, the angle irons shifted, putting the
holes <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/AI%28Cn%29_-_New_Hole.jpg">out
of alignment</a>. I soon realized that opening the hatch doors
all
the way could cause the top 12" beams to shift positions, and that I
could only put a bolt through the hole when the door was closed or
ajar. <br>
<br>
&gt; Once I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/AI%28Cn%29_-_New_Bolt.jpg">fitted
a bolt</a> into the new hole and firmly held together the
top-left
corner of the chassis, I was about to drill a
hole in the top-right corner of the back of CES, when I began to wonder
if the back panel could fit between the back of the bottom assembly,
and the inner side of the back 4" beams. There was a gap between the
left assembly and the bottom assembly to accommodate the panel, but not
on the right side. As a result, I couldn't get the back panel on. So I
did a test to find out what adjustment I would have to make to get the
panel to fit. I removed the two left-side bolts that would hold the
back panel in place, and the bottom-right bolt on the right assembly. I
then slid the back panel in place, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BkP_-_Taped01.jpg">taped
it there</a>. The panel wasn't
even, but it didn't have to be for the time being; I just wanted to see
how the back-right 4" angle iron would fit around the back panel. Not
surprisingly, I wasn't able to put the bottom-right right assembly bolt
into place, but looking at the bolt <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BmA_-_Misplaced_Hole.jpg">from
the inside of the chassis</a> told
me that the bolt hole had to be extended to the right (from the
outside), towards the back of the chassis. So I took CES apart and
isolated the bottom assembly, so I wouldn't risk damaging the side
assemblies. I then drilled into the hole at an angle, towards the back
of the assembly. Not sure if I pushed the hole far enough to the right,
I put the chassis back together and tried again to fit the back panel
into place. The bolt fit though the hole, but it was leaning towards
the left. After taking the chassis apart again, adjusting the hole <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BmA_-_Corrected_Hole.jpg">even
further to the right</a>, re-assembling the chassis, and testing
the
hole
again, the bolt didn't lean as far to the left. One more repetition of
the cycle allowed the bolt to go through the side and bottom assemblies
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BmA_-_Bolt_OK.jpg">straight</a>.<br>
<br>
&gt; Now that there was enough space between the back of
the
bottom assembly and the inner side of the back 4" angle irons for the
back panel to fit into, I put the back panel into place. The panel
already had so many holes in its corners from CES's construction at
Peter's house, that I was surprised when the holes didn't match the
ones on the back of the chassis. One of the holes in the upper-left
hand corner of the panel matched a hole in that part of the chassis,
and I was able to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Chassis_Reconstruction03.jpg">fit
a bolt through</a>. It wasn't easy to fasten the nut
to the bolt, because that was a tight corner between the other bolts
and the overhang of the top 12" angle iron, but I got it on
eventually. The holes in the other three corners of the panel had to be
re-drilled, so once again, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/BkP_-_Taped02.jpg">turned
to Scotch tape</a> to keep the chassis
from shaking while I drilled. Once <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Chassis_Reconstruction04.jpg">all
four bolts were in place</a>, I
noticed that the hole in the upper-right corner of the back of CES was
no good, since it was too close to the right edge, and forced its bolt
into the path of another bolt. So I drilled another hole to the left of
it, one that went through all three surfaces. The hole was further left
than I would have liked it to be, and it didn't match its counterpart
on the left side of the back of the chassis. But there are a lot of
things crooked about CES anyway, and the hole holds the bolt just fine,
so I guess I'll just have to accept it. <br>
<br>
&gt; I finally finished re-assembling the chassis just before 3:30
in
the morning. Once again, I made <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/Table_Mess%2811-1-2004%29.jpg">quite
a mess</a> of the kitchen table, and
I had to wipe it down three times to get all the metal shavings off of
it. There is still a lot to do on this project, and I plan to finish by
the end of the year. But the completion of the chassis is a giant step
towards that goal. It's not going to be easy to finish in two more
months, especially between maintaining Creamy's Wonderland, and reading
one last 60-page chapter of my <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/a.aspx" target="_top">A+
Certification</a> study book, but
somehow, someway, I'll find the time to get everything done on time.
This is the home stretch of the CES project, and as long as I keep my
eyes on the prize, I think I'll be just fine.</font> </font></p>

10/31/2004 - Just after 1PM, I put another
coat of
ink on my side assemblies. There were a few missing spots on the top
areas of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels07.jpg">side
panels</a> I hadn't seen before, so I put a dab of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black
Micron</a> ink on each spot. On the right panel, the halo of one
of the
"E"s had begun to expand upwards as the black ink above it started to
come off, so I had to fix that as well. I also needed my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpies%28Green%29.jpg">green
Sharpies</a>
to fill in some of the flames that had come off of the panels while
Peter and I were drilling holes in their corners. Unfortunately, I
couldn't find a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Black%29.jpg">black
Sharpie</a> to fill the areas under the flames. As
for the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons05.jpg">4" angle
irons</a>, all I did was put another coat of Micron ink on
the exposed areas. The final coating took me only half an hour to
complete. It's nearly three now, so I need to get started on fixing the
protective coats right away.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; At around 3:15,
I brought my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels08.jpg">side
panels</a> outside so I could apply the protective coat
of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Minwax_Polycrylic.jpg">Minwax
Polycrylic</a>. I couldn't decide weather or not to put them in
the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Backyard.jpg">backyard</a>
or the front walkway, because animals could get to it in
the backyard, or leaves could blow on them and ruin the coat. And today
is probably the worst day of the year to let the panel dry on the front
walkway, because some curious trick-or-treater could mess with it. I
decided to take my chances with the front of the house, since this is a
good neighborhood. I laid out the two panels on the walkway, and just
as I was getting ready to apply the protective coat, the wind picked
up, and a big leaf blew on my left panel. So I ran back inside the
house, and grabbed the two big shoeboxes which contain the components
of </font><font size="-2">CES</font><font size="-2">. I took the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hard_Drive01.jpg">hard
drive</a> and the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">slimline
mounting rack</a> out of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log07/MarcEcko_Shoebox.jpg">big
red box</a> and put them into the smaller <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Puma_Shoebox.jpg">Puma
box</a> to make sure they had
enough weight to not get blown away by the wind. Then, I put the boxes
on <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/SP_Between_Shoeboxes.jpg">either
side of the panels</a> so that the leaves wouldn't blow on the
panels. Finally, I sprayed a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/SP_-_Polycrylic01.jpg">really
thick coat</a> of Polycrylic on the
panels, a coat so thick that it left a puddle on the panels. I then
started the timer on my watch, and at the two hour mark, I will bring
them inside for them to dry the rest of the way. There's an hour and a
half left before then, and I just hope none of the trick-or-treaters
touches them.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; After coming
back inside, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_On_Table05.jpg">taped
the four angle irons to the edge of the kitchen
table</a>. I then applied </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail
polish</a></font><font size="-2"> to the areas
where the
last
protective coat peeled off. I will let them sit before applying another
coat. After that coat dries, I will use cardboard sheets to mask off
certain areas of the angle irons, and then apply two or three thin
coats of Polycrylic at one hour intervals. Once all the coats are on
and dried, I will reassemble CES. </font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; Just after four,
I applied the second coat of nail polish to the exposed portions of the
4" angle irons. About a half hour later, I determined that they were
dry enough to start putting on the Polycrylic. My plan was to take the
beams out to the front walkway to apply the Polycrylic. But first, I
needed something to tape the angles to, so that the painted surfaces
could lie horizontally. When I initially did this several months back,
I used a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Donut_Box.jpg">box
of donuts</a>, but since I had long since thrown that away, I
needed something else. So after searching the house for a little while,
I found an empty box of beer bottles. I took the four beams from the
table, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_On_Beer_Box01.jpg">attached</a>
two of them to the bottom edge of the box, and one
on each side near the bottom, without changing the pieces of tape. I
also needed a shield to prevent the spray from hitting the already
protected areas. The search for such a shield was a short one. I found
an old <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Spray_Shield01.jpg">sheet
of cardboard</a> with a one-inch circular hole in it; the same
sheet of cardboard I used as a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PwB_Sim%28Side%29.jpg">simulation</a>
for my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button04.jpg">power
button</a> almost a
year ago.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; I took
everything outside and put the beer box next to the shoeboxes. I then
applied a thin coat of spray on the angle irons by placing the hole in
the cardboard sheet <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/SS01_-_AI%28Mr%29.jpg">over
the areas</a> I wanted to spray, and tapping the
trigger on the Polycrylic spray can. My aim wasn't as good as I would
have liked it to be; I kept missing and would have hit already painted areas of the beams if it wasn't for the cardboard shield.
After the coat was on, I left the beer box outside then went back in.
Its been almost half an hour since I put the coat on the angle irons, so I'll put a
second coat on soon. It's been two hours since I put the thick coat of
Polycrylic on the side panels, but I'm going to wait until the second
coat on the angle irons dries, and then I'll take everything in at
once. It's not even 5:30 and it's already completely dark outside, so
I'm making the second coat on the angle irons the last coat of&nbsp;</font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2">Polycrylic</font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2"> for the day.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; It's after 7PM,
and as soon as I finished typing out the previous paragraph, I applied
a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_On_Beer_Box02.jpg">second
coat of Polycrylic</a> to my angle irons. I used the same method
as last time; using the cardboard eraser shield to mask the areas I
didn't want to spray, and tapping on the button of the spray can to
apply light coats. Fortunately, I had fewer misses this time around. A
half hour later, just after I gave candy to the last trick-or-treaters,
I
brought in the side panels and angle irons. I will wait until ten to
start putting the chassis back together. This way, I can be sure that
all of the coating is dry when I do.</font> </font></p>

10/30/2004 - I got back home to northern
New Jersey
last night after getting a ride from Peter. As I was settling down for
the night, I put <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/CES_Chassis01%28Left%29.jpg">CES</a><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/CES_From_Bed.jpg">in
sight of my bed</a>, and when I woke up this
morning, I noticed something troubling about CES. While still lying in
bed, I could see the left side of CES, and wondered why the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch</a></font><font size="-2">
was facing the wrong way. It didn't take me long to realize that the
left and right assemblies were switched, and I wondered how the hell I
allowed that to happen. But today, after I take CES apart and finish
restoring the paintjob of the side assemblies, I can reassemble the
chassis the right way.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; While checking
the prices of the items on my shopping list, I noticed that the 512MB
stick of PC2100 DDR RAM had gone up in price from $82.50 to $109.99.
There was a cheaper stick of the same RAM for $96, but I thought I
could do even better by going back to </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg</a></font><font size="-2">. One of the RAM sticks I
had my eye on at NewEgg, which was the one from <a href="http://www.pqigroup.com/" target="_top">pqi</a>,
is still available for only
$76. After taxes, the total price of the RAM becomes $80.56. There is
another RAM stick of the same type from a manufacturer called <a href="http://www.allcomponents.com/site/index.shtml" target="_top">All
Components</a> which only costs $74, but just to be conservative,
I'm
going
to stick with the pqi RAM for now, and if possible, switch to a cheaper
RAM module when the time comes to order. The RAM on </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.directron.com/index.html" target="_top">Directron</a></font><font size="-2"> went for
$82.50, but the RAM I now plan to buy from NewEgg costs $80.56

It's after 8PM,
and the restoration of the side assemblies is underway. I brought CES,
a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Black%29.jpg">black</a>
and a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05%28Green%29.jpg">green</a>
Pigma Micron pen, my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpies%28Green&amp;Black%29.jpg">Sharpies</a>,
and my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Toolkit.jpg">toolkit</a>
down to
the kitchen, and then started taking CES apart. I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Cn%29_-_Removed.jpg">removed
the Coins
angle iron</a> first, but then realized it would be a better idea
to
take
the top assembly off first, so <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/CES_-_Topless01.jpg">that's
what I did</a>. After taking off the
top assembly, then the other three 4" angle irons, I began to fill in the
black areas that had been scratched off of the beams, starting with the
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_PPj01.jpg">Koopa
Troopa</a>
beam. As I was filling in the black spots with my black
Micron, I noticed that the pen was pushing off some of the coating. So
I scraped the loose coating off with my fingernail and continued to
fill in the blank spots. But then unexpectedly, some of the black ink
got under the coating, and got onto the right side of the shell of the
turtle! I thought, "Oh fuck no!" and scrambled to grab a paper towel to
try to push the ink back out. No luck. So I decided to wait for the
errant ink to dry while continuing to restore the beams.<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; Some of the most
severe peeling of the coating
happened around the areas where the bolts were screwed on, especially
on the top of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_PPj01.jpg">Mario
beam</a>. This was easy to fix, because all I had
to do was peel away the loose coating with my fingernail, and then fill
in the area with my green Micron. However, the green I put on was a
much lighter green than everything else. So I'm going to give it a
second coat of green once it dries.<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; After waiting
a few more minutes after typing
this out,&nbsp;I'm going to see if I can fix the leaked ink on the
Koopa Troopa angle iron. I know it's a big risk, and I could cause
irreparable damage to the beam, but I think I might be able to reduce
the look of the leak significantly. My plan is to use my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>
to cut out the coating over the right-most orange pixel on the turtle's
shell, wipe away the black, and repaint the orange. I will then follow
suit with the green areas. My biggest concern is that more coating may
peel off than I'm comfortable with, removing even more of the turtle, so I'll put a lot
of pressure on the blade to make a clean cut. Another concern is
further under-leaking, so I'll try to put light coats of ink on.<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; It's now after
11PM, and I've done all I can for
my side assemblies. Just after nine, I applied another coat of black to
the top of the Coins angle iron, and green to the top and bottom of the
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_PPj02.jpg">Mario
beam</a>. Almost an hour later, I began to work on repainting the
area of the Koopa Troopa beam where the black ink leaked. I began by <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_Leak_Fix01.jpg">taping
the beam to the edge of the table</a> with three pieces of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
Tape</a>. I then went to the other side of the table, and cleared
a
space
on the table between myself and the angle iron. Then, using my X-Acto
knife I carefully <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_Leak_Fix02.jpg">cut
out the orange pixel</a> that was covered with the
errant black ink, and was especially careful to stay inside the square.
As I
finished cutting out the tiny square, it began to peel off, and once
I completed the cut, it just fell off the edge of the table. To my
relief, only
the coating in the square was removed, and it didn't take any of the
surrounding coating with it. When I used my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM01%28Orange%29.jpg">orange
Micron</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_Leak_Fix03.jpg">fill
in
the square</a>, it didn't leak under the rest of the coating,
which was
another big
relief. The orange square was a tiny bit too short, so I sliced a
bit off of the top and applied more orange ink. After doing this twice,
I was satisfied with the size of the square. That area of the beam
looked a lot neater, but I still thought it could look better. After
considering weather or not I should risk messing with the Koopa Troopa
beam further, I decided to go ahead and clean it up some more. So I
used my X-Acto knife, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_Leak_Fix04.jpg">cut
out a small portion</a> of the green areas
surrounding the newly fixed orange pixel. Again, no problems, so I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_Leak_Fix05.jpg">filled
in the exposed aluminum</a> with the green Micron. The green was
a
lot lighter than the surrounding green, but I figure that a small,
local coat of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail
polish</a> will neutralize this difference. While I was
making these fixes to the Koopa Troopa angle iron, I continued to apply
additional coats of corrective Micron ink to Coins and Mario. I also
used the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sharpie%28Dark_Green%29.jpg">dark
green Sharpie</a> to repaint a small part of one of the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels07.jpg">side
panels</a></font><font size="-2">
that lost some of its ink.<br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; When I was done
repainting the side assembly, I
brought CES's parts back up to my bedroom. I'm going to let the ink dry
overnight, and tomorrow on Halloween, I will apply the local coats of
nail polish and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Minwax_Polycrylic.jpg">Polycrylic</a>
on the angle irons. I will also apply one
really thick coat of Polycrylic on the side panels, something I thought
about doing since I applied the four thin coats to them. Once
everything dries fully, I will reassemble the chassis, making sure to
put the side assemblies on their correct sides of the bottom assembly.</font>

10/28/2004 - After 2PM
this afternoon, I decided to
continue work on the Creamy Entertainment System without help from
Peter. I was worried that the 17 </font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2">centimeter</font></font><font size="-2"><font size="-2"> square P4 mini-itx
motherboard wouldn't fit into the chassis. I was afraid that too much
of the 12" x 7" bottom panel had been <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/BmP_-_Shaved.jpg">stripped
off</a>, and that not enough
room was left to bolt the motherboard into place with its spacer holes.
When I measured the strip from the bottom panel, it was nearly half an
inch wide, leaving the panel to be narrower than the motherboard. But
then, I remembered that the motherboard's backplate would line up with
the back panel, sticking beyond the chassis' interior, giving me
slightly more room to work with.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; I decided to
begin work on the chassis by securing the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Bottom_Assembly01.jpg">bottom
assembly</a>. Yesterday,
Peter had drilled the holes in the assembly, but only put the bolts in
without securing them. So I took the assembly apart to turn the bolts
around to face upwards, and then I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Bottom_Assembly02.jpg">secured
the nuts onto them</a>. As I was
examining the left assembly to bolt it together, I noticed that there
were <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28KT%29_-_PPj01.jpg">two
missing spots</a> along the right edge of the Koopa Troopa angle
iron. It kind of surprised me that such neat spots were made in the
beam's paintjob, since it was covered with four coats of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail
polish</a>
and four coats of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Minwax_Polycrylic.jpg">Minwax
Polycrylic</a>. Fortunately, the spots were
entirely black areas of the paintjob, so fixing it shouldn't be too
hard. The next holes I planned to drill were the horizontal holes on
the left side of the bottom assembly. I fitted the top bolts of
the left assembly <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Left_Assembly01.jpg">in
place</a>, then erased a drill mark that Peter made in
the bottom assembly's left side the night before. I put the left
assembly in its place on the bottom assembly, and tried to make marks
on the bottom assembly by pushing a pen through the bottom holes in the
left assembly. The Pilot Precise Rolling Ball Pen couldn't leave a
mark, so I switched to my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a>, which did a decent
job of making the marks. With the drill marks on the bottom-left 7" in
place, I removed it from the bottom assembly. I then removed the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Unibit.jpg">cone-shaped
drill bit</a></font><font size="-2"> from the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Drill_Press.jpg">drill
press</a></font><font size="-2">,
and replaced it with my
11/64" bit. I put the 7" beam on top of a block of wood on the drill
press's tray, and with the drill turned off, cranked the bit down to
touch one of the drill marks, and centered it carefully. Then holding
the angle iron steady, I turned on the drill and cranked down the bit
through the hole, and then followed the same pattern with the other
hole.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; After the holes
were drilled, I returned the 7" beam to the bottom assembly and bolted
it together, when I noticed a major problem. Even though the holes in
the bottom panel were oversized, they still couldn't fully accommodate
the bolts, which were forced to go through the assembly at an angle.
This of course meant that the assembly wasn't put together solidly, and
kept wobbling. At that point I felt that I might not only have to order
another pair of 7" angle irons from <a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a>,
but another 12" x
7" panel as well, and I began to doubt if I could afford to do that.
But for the time being, I decided to remove the bottom panel, and just
continue as if nothing was wrong.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; When I tried to
bolt the left assembly to the bottom assembly, the left assembly's
bottom-right bolt wouldn't go through the hole I had just drilled in
the 7" beam. I started to think that I might have to re-order a third
7" angle iron. But after a long and hard effort, I managed to fix the
wrongly placed hole by using the drill press to extend the hole to the
right. The hardest part was fighting against the press as it kept
trying to drill through the completed hole, rather than extending it to
one side. After I fixed the wayward hole, I discovered yet another
problem. The bottom bolts in the left assembly ran very close to the
12" angle irons of the bottom assembly, and didn't leave enough room to
fit nuts on. I figured that my best chance of getting around this was
to slice off a bit of the ends of the 12" beams to make room, but I
decided to wait for Peter to return from work instead of trying
anything myself. But then I found that the problem was more serious
than I thought. The blank sides of the Coins and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28FF%29_-_PPj01.jpg">Fire
Flower</a> beams had
their bottom holes drilled too low, so their bolts would also run too
close to the 12" beams. But I decided to ignore the problem and focus
on completing the right assembly.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; To begin putting
together the right assembly, I used the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_PPj01.jpg">Mario</a>
and Fire Flower beams to
mark drill holes on the bottom-right 7" angle iron. I then detached
the beam from the bottom assembly, and drilled its holes in the same
manner as the other 7" beam. When I re-attached the beam to the bottom
assembly, and then bolted the right assembly in place, <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/BmA_Bolts_-_OK.jpg">the
bolts fit
through the holes neatly</a>. On a hunch, I put the bottom panel
back
into the
bottom assembly, but this time I put it on backwards. Surprisingly, the
bolts fit easily through the holes, and I when I fitted on the nuts,
the bottom assembly was much more secure than it was before. And so it
seemed that I wouldn't need to order another 12" x 7" panel after all.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; After the bottom
panel was in place, I saw that the horizontal bolts at the bottom of
the chassis were actually touching the bottom panel, and that simply
cutting off some of the 12" beams wasn't going to be enough to fix the
problem. So I came up with a new idea; to raise the side assemblies so
the nuts would have enough room to fit on the bolts. When Peter came
home, I addressed the problem to him as well as my solution, and soon
we were in the basement working on it. We tried to rest the side
assemblies on a notepad and a thin, wooden slab, but found the
combination to be uneven. This made it harder to get the side
assemblies level, but after several hours of work, and a lot of
measuring with a triangle-shaped square, we were able to fit the side
assembles to the bottom assembly, and keep them fairly parallel to the
table. We couldn't get it right on the first try, so we ended up making
some extra holes in the blank side of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons05.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>, and on the
back panel.</font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; I don't remember
the rest of the night very well, but I'll try to include what I can in
this report. We had a rather tough time trying to get the back panel in
place, and Peter had to use the cone-shaped drill bit to drill <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Back_Panel02.jpg">a
lot of
oversized holes</a> in it. When the chassis started to come
together,
Peter
found it easier to use a hand drill rather than to take apart the
chassis. At the end of the night, Peter decided to attach the top
assembly to the rest of the chassis. While putting the assembly
together, he kept the rivet
holding the 7" beam and the 12" beam in
place. He was even able to salvage the two <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_Errant_Holes.jpg">7"
beams</a> I thought </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font><font size="-2"> and I
had ruined during a previous building session at JD's place. This meant
that I wouldn't have to order anything else from OnlineMetals.com,
giving my budget a major break. </font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; Once the top
assembly was in place, the last thing to go on was the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a></font><font size="-2">, which
Peter
bolted to the horizontal edges of the top 7" beams.
My original idea of attaching the hatch doors was to bolt them to the
vertical edges of the beams, and cut off the middle 5 inches of each 7"
beam to make room for the doors. Peter attached the two far bolts of
each door the the 7" beams first, making oversized holes in the beams.
After making sure the doors lined up, Peter then worked on attaching
the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Roller_Catches01.jpg">roller
catches</a> for the doors. He began by drilling two big holes in
the top-rear 12" beam where the doors' halves of the catches would go.
But we discovered that the holes themselves made really good catches,
and decided that the rollers weren't necessary. </font><font size="-2"><br>
<br>
</font> <font size="-2">&gt; When I went to Peter's house
on Tuesday, I expected to only get the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/CES_Chassis01%28Left%29.jpg">chassis</a>
completed, minus the </font><font size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a></font><font size="-2">
and top hatch. The fitting of the top hatch is certainly a
pleasant bonus, and will be one less thing I'll have to worry about
during November, which I plan to be the final month of the build. The
project will now focus on attaching the internal components to CES,
including the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Slimline_Drive_Rack01.jpg">slimline
drive rack</a> and the motherboard.
Also, I still have to order over $500 in parts, so I'll have to somehow
find work sometime early next month. I'm really excited about how the
rest of the project is going to go, and I'm keeping CES in my room so I
can spend the next hour or so figuring out what to do next.</font>

10/27/2004 - My
parents and I arrived at Peter's house yesterday afternoon, and then we
went out to look at a couple more houses. The trip was boring as hell
and took several hours, and so I was relieved when we got back at the
house. After my parents left for home, my brother took me to a local <a href="http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=home" target="_top">Lowe's</a>
hardware store, where I bought an 11/64" drill bit with some of my
emergency cash. (I accidentally left my wallet at home, so I had to
rely on this money. Besides, I would have brought along <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Drill_Bits02.jpg">my
dad's set of
drill bits</a>, if I had remembered to do so.) Today, when Peter
gets
back
from work, we will start building CES's chassis. It's just after 5PM
right now, so I don't think I'll have to wait too much longer.<br>
<br>
&gt; It's after 10PM, and Peter and I worked on CES's chassis, but
we
didn't have enough time to finish the whole thing in one go. We began
by setting up the workshop, and this involved clearing the work table,
and moving a large <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Drill_Press.jpg">drill
press</a> which was very heavy. When the
workstation was ready, I demonstrated how the angle irons and panels of
CES would be put together. I then laid out the bottom assembly except
for the 12" x 7" </font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">.
I put two </font><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">12"</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);"> beams</span></a>
on top of two <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_Angle_Irons.jpg"><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">7"</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">
beams</span></a> in a rectangle pattern, and reminded Peter
that a portion of the
12" sides of bottom panel would have to be shaved off in order to fit
within the bottom assembly. Peter marked where he wanted to cut the
panel, but I was worried that he was taking too much of the side off,
and there may not be enough room on the panel for the vertical bolts to
go through the panel and assembly. He assured me that the panel would
still be wide enough to accommodate the bolts, and proceeded to cut at
the mark. He used a red, plier-like <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Shears.jpg">cutting
tool</a>, and following the
mark, cut about two inches into the panel. After that, we began to
consider better alternatives on cutting through the rest of the mark,
and went to the garage to pick out another tool. We eventually settled
on the table saw, but changed to another blade; a thicker one with a
smoother edge, a blade the Peter found in one of the garage's drawers.
After testing the blade on my spare
side panel, Peter finished cutting <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/BmP_-_Shaved.jpg">the
rest of the way through</a> the bottom panel. The saw was
extremely
loud cutting through the aluminum, and left a strange smell.<br>
<br>
&gt; We then continued work on the bottom assembly by drilling the
vertical holes in the 7" and 12" angle irons. Unlike the table saw, the
drill press made very little noise as it cut through the aluminum. We
then put in a bolt in each of the four corner holes. Peter measured the
holes by marking the positions of the bolts, although I suggested that
he temporarily tape the chassis together, remove the bolts, and then
mark the holes in the panel through the holes in the angle irons. Peter
decided to mark the holes his way, and then drilled the four corner
holes in the bottom panel. He then made the holes even bigger by
switching to a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Unibit.jpg">cone-shaped
drill bit</a>. We then put the panel into
its assembly, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Bottom_Assembly01.jpg">put
the bolts back into place</a>. The bottom panel's
drill holes matched those of the angle irons, so his way of measuring
was apparently accurate. The heads of the bolts stuck up, and were not
fitted into place with the nuts. <br>
<br>
&gt; The next task was to drill the holes in the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Four_Inch_Angle_Irons04.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>. This
was a crucial step, because these were the angles with the <font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"> patterns painted on
them. Peter carefully measured
the center
of the spent "?" block at the top of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_Coating02.jpg">Mario
beam</a> by taking a piece
of paper, bridging the corners, and marking the middle of the block. He
repeated with the other two corners, making an <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_X.jpg">"X"
pattern</a>. The corners
were not as clear on the 3D block at the bottom of the beam, so it took
Peter longer to make the measurements. I don't exactly know how he made
the measurements, but the mark appeared to be in the center of the
block. He then drew a large dot in the middle of the X mark, and one in
the middle of the bottom mark. When I took a look at the beam, I
noticed that the mark at the top was slightly off to one side, and
advised Peter to compensate when drilling the holes. Peter then <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Drilling_AI%28Mr%29.jpg">drilled
the holes</a> in the Mario beam, and I was very nervous at that
point,
because I knew that the beams I spent nearly a month painting were
going through another irreversible step. When I took a look at the
beam, I was relieved to see that the holes were <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI%28Mr%29_-_PPj01.jpg">fairly
centered</a> on the
blocks. Drilling the holes in the rest of the beams was just a matter
of using the holes in the Mario beam as a template to mark the other
beams, and then drilling the appropriate holes. Mercifully, the holes
all appeared to be in the right positions.<br>
<br>
&gt; The rest of the night's work is kind of a blur to me, but we
spent
most of our time measuring for the holes in the chassis. While I held
the chassis
still, Peter marked the holes. We centered the words of the </font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels06.jpg">side
panels</a></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">
between the </font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">4"
beams</font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2">, made the marks, and
drilled the holes. While
centering the left panel, the left edge of the words and the right edge
of the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LtP_-_Green_Arrow04.jpg">down
arrow</a> brushed against the 4" beams, because there was
barely enough room for them. I noticed at one point, the bolts on
the upper right corner of the back of the chassis ran into each other.
However, I still have a hope that the angle irons of the top assembly
will push the bolts out just enough to cause them to miss each other. I
showed Peter how I planned to attach the </font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="Book Antiqua" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/TpH_-_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch</a></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
to the rest of the chassis; by bolting the
hinges to the inner vertical edges of the top 7" beams. My plan was to
cut out the middle of these beams, leaving one inch on either
side for the vertical bolts. He didn't think this was a good idea, and
instead suggested that I keep the 7" beams intact, and bolt the hinges
on top the the horizontal edges. I'm not yet sure if I'm going to go
with that option, but I still have plenty of time to make such a decision.
When we finally decided to call it a night, most of the holes of the
chassis had been drilled. The only holes not drilled were the
horizontal holes in the bottom assembly, the holes in the right
panel,
and all holes in the back panel except for the upper right hole. We're
going to continue and hopefully finish the chassis (sans the </span><a style="font-family: Press Start K;" href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Projects/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a><span style="font-family: Press Start K;">
and top hatch) tomorrow evening.</span></font></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><br>
