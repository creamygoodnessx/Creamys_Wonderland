Today, I finished the last of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM's animations, and compiled all 20 of his animations into a 198
frame
choreography. The next time I update Creamy's Wonderland, I will have a
new front page mural, there will be a new major section to the site,
and
I will announce a major name change. If I'm lucky, I'll have all this
ready
by next February.</font></font></font>

Today is Creamy's Wonderland's fourth birthday, and for the first time
in the site's history, I don't have a special mural for the occasion. I
realised CW's birthday was coming up less than a week before today, and
by then it was too late to start making a mural. Besides, I didn't have
any ideas for one anyway. This isn't really much of an update; I only
added
a short comment on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>/<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Conlangs_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Conlangs</a>
page, and finished another one of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib's</a>
animations.</font></font></font>

It's been nearly a month since my last update, but hey, that seems to
be
CW's trend nowadays. I've completed three more animations for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM, bringing the total number of finished animations to fifteen out of
twenty. I also rebuilt Dib's Attack animation, so that it now shows far
less recoil than before.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font size="+1"><font color="#009900">&gt; Have
I, Jason
"Creamy Goodness" Tenn, achieved instant fame and a global celebrity
status?
Maybe not, but there is a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Sources/creamy01.jpg">picture</a>
of me in <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/Magazine/" target="_top">Game

I'd like to once again thank the The3DGuy
for bringing this up on this thread of <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>'s</font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://boards.polycount.net/ubbthreads.php" target="_top">message

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">&gt; Ever

the Polycount folks deleted my webpage several months ago, the zips on
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/SkinsIcons_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Skins

After much consideration, I've decided to dismantle the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>/Follycount
section of Creamy's Wonderland. While I still have some ideas in mind
for
the section, I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about it as I was when I
first
started. If I ever decide to bring back Follycount, it will no longer
be
a parody of <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>,
and thus it will have a different name. As for now, I'm removing the
Follycount
link from all pages of CW's left frame menu. The section won't really
be
gone though, as it can still be accessed through links in the news
archive.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">&gt; I may
have
taken down my Follycount section, but I'm making up for it by rigging
up
a new one. The new <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">QuakeCon
section</a> features my reports of the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
events I've attended, and if I go to any future events, I'll be sure to
report those too. I'm also featuring some of the pictures I took of the
event, as well as network games I may have recorded.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">&gt; I
just found
out that <a href="http://www.TheCounter.com" target="_top">TheCounter.com</a>
has stopped offering its free service, which is probably why my counter
button stopped displaying the hit count. I'll have to find another free
counter service, since there's no way in hell I'm going to start paying
just to find out how many people come to my site. The new service I
choose
will have have a feature that counts only one hit per Internet session
per user, just like TheCounter.com did.</font></font></font>

I've done a bit more work on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>
model, finishing his three remaining taunt animations. Now, twelve out
of his twenty animations are finished, with only the Crouch and Death
animations
remaining. The <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Animations</a>

It's been over a month since Creamy's Wonderland's last update, but
I've
gotten a bunch of things done since then. I've done a minor renovation
of the mesh of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>
model, as well as add a new animation to it. The Config File Setup</font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T/Episodes-CFS_Media.html">movie
clips</a> have been re-uploaded to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/" target="_top">FilePlanet</a>.
I didn't know that when the folks at <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
nuked my site, they also nuked my FP directory, and all of the movies
in
it. The <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&amp;Bones_Page.html">Mesh
&amp; Bones</a> page of my Quake2 <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">modeling
tutorial</a> now includes a method of using <a href="http://www.hash.com/" target="_top">Animation:
Master</a>'s SmartSkin feature to animate a model's eyes with ease.
Finally,
in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section, the research
notes for Chapter 5 of Of
Pandas and People are up and ready for public viewing.</font></font></font>

PPM is finished, and so are seven of its twenty animations. A couple
days
ago, I noticed that I made a mistake in my Quake2 <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">modeling
tutorial</a>. It turns out that the peak of the Jump animation is
actually
on the second frame instead of the third, so I fixed that error in this
update. And now the big news. I've finally gotten around to starting
the
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Conlangs_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">conlangs</a>
for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> story. As of now, I only have a phonic list of words that
don't
have meanings, but I plan to expand on this once I do the right
research.
Oh by the way, If you were wondering why the Quake2 section was full of
broken images today, that's because I've been moving some files around,
so that I could get rid of my obsolete HON folder, and make my
directory
structure a little neater. Sorry for the inconvenience.</font></font></font>

Late last night, I finished my research
notes for Chapter 4 of Of
Pandas and People, and I finished the icon for the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page.html">Animations</a>
section of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">modeling
tutorial</a> this morning. I also decided to make a quick change to the
Animations page, so that I'll need to take fewer screenshots further on
down the line. That is all.</font></font></font>

I hope you like the new front page mural I put up on this page. It's
called
FilePlanet Line, something I completed way back on the first day of
this
year. I also updated the Of
Pandas and People page in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood's</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900">Research
Notes section. As for Evil Blood's story, I've come up with a
possible
change in the plot, and you can find it on the spoiler page in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/EB_Zodian_Threat%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Zodian
Threat</a> section. As with all spoilers, you shouldn't view this plot
change unless you don't care about having the story given away to you
prematurely.
But since I may not come out with the finished comic for several years
if ever, you may forget what you saw, or the spoilers may no longer be
true by the time this whole thing gets finished.</font></font></font></p>
