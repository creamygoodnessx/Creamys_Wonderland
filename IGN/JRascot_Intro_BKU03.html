Hey, I'm Jason "Creamy Goodness" Tenn, formerly known as Jatoten Rascot.
Welcome to my humble digital abode, Creamy's Wonderland, formerly known
as the Infinite World of Wonder. This site is where I display both my 2D
and 3D art, as well as my developing fantasy story, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>. This site is always being updated, but I try to work on it at
a comfortable pace. Enjoy your stay.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font size=+1><font color="#99FF99">12/23/2003 -</font><font color="#33FF33">
Today, I finished the last of my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM's animations, and compiled all 20 of his animations into a 198 frame
choreography. The next time I update Creamy's Wonderland, I will have a
new front page mural, there will be a new major section to the site, and
I will announce a major name change. If I'm lucky, I'll have all this ready
by next February.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>11/11/2003 -
I updated <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Jonny-V(fs).html" target="_top">Jonny-V's</a>
page in the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Characters_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Characters</a>
section of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> today. I also activated some links on <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Oinkillune(fs).html" target="_top">Oinkillune's</a>
page. That is all.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/2/2003 -
Today is Creamy's Wonderland's fourth birthday, and for the first time
in the site's history, I don't have a special mural for the occasion. I
realised CW's birthday was coming up less than a week before today, and
by then it was too late to start making a mural. Besides, I didn't have
any ideas for one anyway. This isn't really much of an update; I only added
a short comment on the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>/<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Conlangs_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Conlangs</a>
page, and finished another one of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib's</a>
animations.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>9/29/2003 -
It's been nearly a month since my last update, but hey, that seems to be
CW's trend nowadays. I've completed three more animations for my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM, bringing the total number of finished animations to fifteen out of
twenty. I also rebuilt Dib's Attack animation, so that it now shows far
less recoil than before.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>> Have I, Jason
"Creamy Goodness" Tenn, achieved instant fame and a global celebrity status?
Maybe not, but there is a <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Sources/Creamy01.jpg">picture</a>
of me in <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/Magazine/" target="_top">Game
Informer</a>&nbsp; magazine from my visit to this year's <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>.
I'd like to once again thank the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/the3dguy/home.htm" target="_top">The3DGuy</a>
for bringing this up on this thread of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/" target="_top">Polycount's</a>
<a href="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true" target="_top">message
boards</a>.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>> Ever since
the Polycount folks deleted my webpage several months ago, the zips on
my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/SkinsIcons_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Skins
and Icons</a> page were gone. I didn't realize this until a couple of days
ago, and now the problem is fixed.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>8/30/2003 -
After much consideration, I've decided to dismantle the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>/Follycount
section of Creamy's Wonderland. While I still have some ideas in mind for
the
section, I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about it as I was when I first
started. If I ever decide to bring back Follycount, it will no longer be
a parody of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/" target="_top">Polycount</a>,
and thus it will have a different name. As for now, I'm removing the Follycount
link from all pages of CW's left frame menu. The section won't really be
gone though, as it can still be accessed through links in the news archive.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>> I may have
taken down my Follycount section, but I'm making up for it by rigging up
a new one. The new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/QuakeCon_Page(fs).html" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
section features my reports of the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
events I've attended, and if I go to any future events, I'll be sure to
report those too. I'm also featuring some of the pictures I took of the
event, as well as network games I may have recorded.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>> I just found
out that <a href="http://www.TheCounter.com" target="_top">TheCounter.com</a>
has stopped offering its free service, which is probably why my counter
button stopped displaying the hit count. I'll have to find another free
counter service, since there's no way in hell I'm going to start paying
just to find out how many people come to my site. The new service I choose
will have have a feature that counts only one hit per Internet session
per user, just like TheCounter.com did.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>7/31/2003 -
I've done a bit more work on my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
model, finishing his three remaining taunt animations. Now, twelve out
of his twenty animations are finished, with only the Crouch and Death animations
remaining. The <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Animations</a>

<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">modelling
tutorial</a> now explains in better detail how to reverse a Grenade Toss
animation, and also includes the images. Finally, the Fan Art section of
my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/art_page(fs).html" target="_top">Art
Gallery</a> has been renamed to something more appropriate: <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/art_gallery/art_fans(fs).html" target="_top">Gift

It's been over a month since Creamy's Wonderland's last update, but I've
gotten a bunch of things done since then. I've done a minor renovation
of the mesh of my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
model, as well as add a new animation to it. The <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T/Episodes-CFS_Media.html">movie
clips</a> have been re-uploaded to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/" target="_top">FilePlanet</a>.
I didn't know that when the folks at <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
nuked my site, they also nuked my FP directory, and all of the movies in
it. The <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&Bones_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Mesh
&amp; Bones</a> page of my Quake2 <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">modelling
tutorial</a> now includes a method of using <a href="http://www.hash.com/" target="_top">Animation:
Master's</a> SmartSkin feature to animate a model's eyes with ease. Finally,
in the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section, the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">research
notes</a> for Chapter 5 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">Of

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>6/3/2003 - The
mesh and skeleton of my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM is finished, and so are seven of its twenty animations. A couple days
ago, I noticed that I made a mistake in my Quake2 <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">modelling
tutorial</a>. It turns out that the peak of the Jump animation is actually
on the second frame instead of the third, so I fixed that error in this
update. And now the big news. I've finally gotten around to starting the
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Conlangs_Page(fs).html" target="_top">conlangs</a>
for my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> story. As of now, I only have a phonic list of words that don't
have meanings, but I plan to expand on this once I do the right research.
Oh by the way, If you were wondering why the Quake2 section was full of
broken images today, that's because I've been moving some files around,
so that I could get rid of my obsolete HON folder, and make my directory
structure a little neater. Sorry for the inconvenience.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>5/28/2003 -
Late last night, I finished my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">research
notes</a> for Chapter 4 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">Of
Pandas and People</a>, and I finished the icon for the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Animations</a>
section of my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
PPM <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">modelling
tutorial</a> this morning. I also decided to make a quick change to the
Animations page, so that I'll need to take fewer screenshots further on
down the line. That is all.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>5/20/2003 -
I hope you like the new front page mural I put up on this page. It's called
FilePlanet Line, something I completed way back on the first day of this
year. I also updated the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">Of
Pandas and People</a> page in <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood's</a> <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Research
Notes</a> section. As for Evil Blood's story, I've come up with a possible
change in the plot, and you can find it on the spoiler page in the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/EB_Zodian_Threat(fs).html" target="_top">Zodian
Threat</a> section. As with all spoilers, you shouldn't view this plot
change unless you don't care about having the story given away to you prematurely.
But since I may not come out with the finished comic for several years
if ever, you may forget what you saw, or the spoilers may no longer be
true by the time this whole thing gets finished.</font></font></font>
