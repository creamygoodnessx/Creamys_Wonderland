  <font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><br>7/8/2004 - I woke up
yesterday afternoon at four, so it was too late for me to walk to <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a>. However, I noticed my mother about to go out around five,
and
when I asked for a ride to Pearl, she said she could take me the next
day.
So I guess I'm going later today, assuming I can get up early enough.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; At around
six, I began
work again on the guiding grid of my left panel by untaping the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">ruler</a>.
I then used the 136 pairs of guiding dots to begin drawing the grid.
Using
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">pink
mechanical pencil</a>, and following the guiding dots, I started to
draw
every other vertical line from right to left, but about ten lines in, I
decided to draw <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid01.jpg">every
fifth line</a> from left to right instead. This created a repeating
pattern
of four pairs of dots, and a vertical line. I then drew <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid02.jpg">a
line for the second and third pair of dots</a> in each 5mm section from
right to left. When I got to the left-most edge, the lines were very
unevenly
spaced apart, so I had to erase the first four vertical lines, and then
redraw them. Finally, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid03.jpg">I
drew the rest of the vertical lines</a>, and doing so was relatively
easy,
because all of the remaining pair of dots had a vertical line
immediately
on either side. This made it easy to tell if any of the guiding dots
were
off-center, and allowed me to make the proper adjustments while drawing
the last of the lines. Despite my concerns at the end of the previous
session,
the vertical lines turned out to be fairly evenly spaced apart. I'm
going
to take a break, and then proceed with the horizontal lines. I was
supposed
to finish painting the panel yesterday and finish drawing the guiding
grids
for the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a> today, so I still have a lot of catching up to do.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I returned to
the
kitchen around 2:30AM to draw the horizontal lines of the grid. I drew
the guiding dots on either side with my mechanical pencil, but drew
every
fifth dot with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black
Micron</a>. Because there were only 20 dots on each side, I didn't need
to tape the ruler in place. After I drew the guiding dots, I noticed
that
the line that marked the top of the flame pattern was uneven; the left
end was 21mm away from the top of the panel, but the right side was
22mm
down from the top. Fortunately, when I drew the horizontal 5mm mark
lines,
I found that only the line at the top of the flames was severely off,
while
the lines I just drew were not off by all that much. After drawing the
guiding dots at the sides of the panel, I realized that I left-most
vertical
line was drawn over the tape that held the panel to the protective
paper
cover. I cut off the part of the tape that the line was on with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>, and then redrew the line. However, I scratched the aluminum
in the process. Hopefully, the upcoming paint job will conceal the
scratch.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; By the time I
had
finished drawing the horizontal 5mm mark lines, I noticed that the
penciled
dots on the left side of the panel faded quickly, so I decided to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid04.jpg">redraw
them all with the black Micron</a>. But this time, I let the ink sit
for
about half an hour before drawing the horizontal lines. As for the rest
of the horizontal lines, I followed the same procedure as with the
vertical
ones. Drawing every fifth horizontal line created a pattern of one
line,
and then four pairs of dots, and then another line, and four more pairs
of dots, etc. I drew the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid05.jpg">lines
for every second and third pair of dots</a> in each group. This left
each
remaining pair of dots with a horizontal line immediately above and
below
it, allowing me to easily <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Name_Grid06.jpg">fill
in the rest of the grid</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The grid was
completed
just after four in the morning, and so I poured myself a glass of <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/nonflash_entry.php" target="_top">Pepsi</a>,
then went to work on the paint job right away. I opened the image of
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Left_Panel04.gif">pattern</a>
I wanted to paint on Paint
Shop Pro 4, and zoomed in to a 10:1 ratio. When I painted the words
on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel03.jpg">right
panel</a>, I drew a 10 x 10 pixel marquee and put it over each letter
as
I painted its counterpart on the aluminum. This was because every
letter
was the same block size; 10 x 10 pixels, including the blank left and
bottom
edges reserved to evenly space the letters apart. However this time
around,
the letters varied in size, and did not have the same block size, so it
wouldn't be practical to draw a marquee around each letter as I worked.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Not long
after I started
working on the paintjob, I started having the first of many problems. I
was drawing the light green portions of the image, and had drawn the
light
green half of the "C" in CES, and the light green half of "Creamy",
when
I noticed that the "C" in "Creamy" was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel_Name01.jpg">one
pixel too far too the left</a>, and therefore every pixel drawn after
it
was one pixel too far to the left. So I tried to fix it by carefully
using
toothpicks to erase the errant pixels. I also used the black Micron to
fill in areas where the green pixels were, but black ones should have
been.
After I had filled in a number of pixels in the bottom row with their
proper
colors, I noticed that the green and black pixels were <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel_Name02.jpg">hopelessly
smudged together</a>. This left me no choice but to fog the area with
my
breath, wrap the eraser end of the pencil with a paper towel, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel_Name03.jpg">wipe
the area clean</a>. Unfortunately, this meant erasing a significant
portion
of the grid as well. So after I took a quick shower to help take my
mind
off of the disaster, I came back and successfully <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel_Name04.jpg">redrew
the grid</a>. I used the green marker to fill in the appropriate
squares
with light green, and this time I had no problems.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; It's almost
9PM now,
and I got back from Pearl Paint this afternoon. The hunter green <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a> was still sold out, but I did manage to find an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/PM01_Orange.jpg">orange
Micron 01 pen</a>. I will use this marker for Mario's skin on one of my
4" angle irons. I also found a small can of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Krylon_Acrylic.jpg">Krylon
Crystal Clear acrylic spray</a>, with the help of one of the sales
people.
I will test this acrylic on one of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Cutouts01.jpg">top
hatch aluminum scraps</a> by painting a pattern on the panel, letting
it
dry, and then spraying it with the acrylic. If the ink remains intact,
and if I can't scratch it off with some reasonable effort, I will use
it
on the real thing once the paint job is finished. I paid $1.93 for the
orange Micron, and $2.67 for the acrylic spray, but because these items
will not be a part of CES, they will not effect the project's budget.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Because I
couldn't
find the hunter green, I will finish the words on the panel with only
the
green that I already have. I was having concerns that the hunter green
might be difficult to see in front of a black background, so I don't
think
that this is a bad decision. While I was at Pearl, I found that there
was
a Micron that was a lighter green than the one I've been using. I'll
keep
checking back periodically, and the next time I see the light green
Microns
in stock, I'll pick one up, unless the hunter greens beat them to it. I
will then use the standard green along with the green that I find first
to paint the 4" angle irons.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; It's just
after 10PM
now, and I painted <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/RHC_Test_Pattern01.jpg">two
test patterns</a> on one of the scrap aluminum panel a little earlier,
one in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Pigma_Microns_02.jpg" target="_top">Pigma
Microns</a>, the other in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green&amp;Black_Sharpies.jpg">Sharpies</a>.
Each pattern has four squares with two colors in a checkerboard
pattern,
surrounded by a thick black border. Tomorrow, I will take it outside
and
spray the scrap with the acrylic coating, and the result will determine
weather or not I use the spray to protect my side panels. A little
later
in the night, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Left_Panel_Name06.jpg">I
finished the letters</a> on the left panel with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Green.jpg">green
Micron</a>. After dinner, I will paint the black background, and hope
the
black and green ink doesn't smudge together again.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/7/2004 -
Yesterday,
I began working towards getting the name of CES painted on its left
panel.
However, the words and lettering are going to be different this time
around.
Instead of saying "<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Right_Panel02.gif">THE
CREAMY ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM</a>" in the classic NES font in a three row
format, I'm going to paint the words, "<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Left_Panel04.gif">CES
- built by Jason "Creamy Goodness" Tenn</a>" in the <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/" target="_top">Legend
of Zelda</a>: <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=la" target="_top">Link's
Awakening</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=fonts#226" target="_top">font</a>.
I'm using a smaller letters, which allows me to put the words in a two
row format. The letters, from the top of the tallest letter to the
lowest
point of the "y", are going to be 10 pixels high. Each pixel will be
one
square millimeter, just like on the right panel, meaning the words will
take up an overall height of two centimeters, which is the height of
the
area above the flames. This means that I won't have to erase any part
of
the flame pattern to make room for the words, like I did with the word
"SYSTEM" on the right panel. So needless to say, finishing the left
panel
should be a hell of a lot easier than completing the right one. Unlike
the right panel, I definitely will be using two shades of green this
time
around. On the top row of letters, each letter will have their top
halves
dark green, and their bottom halves light green, and the reverse will
be
true of the letters on the bottom row. This should give the illusion of
a dark green lettering with a light green stripe running across the
middle.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; After placing
the
left panel on top of a paper towel, I began drawing the dots for the
guiding
grid yesterday evening. I taped the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">ruler</a>
onto the top of the aluminum panel, millimeter side up and facing the
panel.
I then folded the bottom of the protective paper up and over the flames
to protect them from any accidental rubbing off. I got about halfway
done
with drawing the dots along the top of the panel, when I had to go into
town to grab a <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/nonflash_entry.php" target="_top">Pepsi</a>
and some candy. When I got back home, I was so beat from the walk back
I crashed for a few hours. It wasn't until 11:30PM when I got back to
my
panel, and I finally drew all of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Ruler_Top.jpg">guiding
dots</a> on the top of the panel, 136 dots which were 1mm apart. I cut
the ruler free of the panel, and was about to start drawing the bottom
row of guiding dots, when I realized that the pencil marks I made on
the
top of the panel were too faded to see clearly, and also some of them
were
uneven. So I taped the ruler back onto the top of the panel, and redraw
some of the faded dots. The dots kept fading, so I finally used my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black
Pigma Micron</a> instead. After all 136 dots were redrawn, I let them
dry
while I took a short break. The ink should be dry by now, so I'll get
continue
on with the bottom of the 2cm section after I finish eating. It's just
after three in the morning, so I'm not sure if I can get this grid done
before I hit the hay.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Before I
continue,
I would like to point out that I'm trying to get this project done by
the
end of the month. If I can't, fine, no big deal, but it would be nice
to
have an entire year before the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
of 2005 to really enjoy my completed machine, and to install the proper
upgrades for the QuakeCon's case mod contest. After I wake up this
afternoon,
I will run over to <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a> and see if the hunter green <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron</a> has been restocked. I'll also see if they have Microns in
white
and tan for the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/Four_Beam_Collage.gif">angle
iron patterns</a>, and some lacquer for the finishing coat. When I get
back, I will fill in all of the squares on the grid that I can with the
appropriate Microns, with or without the dark green pen. Tomorrow, I'll
draw the 1" x 4", 1/16 sq in grid on each of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>, and on the next day, use the Microns to fill in the <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> patterns. Saturday the 10th will be the day I put a
second coat of paint on the sheets and angle irons, and then spray
everything
with the lacquer to officially finish CES's paintjob. Finally, on
Sunday,
I'll see if I can get to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house to use his vertical drill press, so I can drill the bolts holes
in
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom</a>
and side panels and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Angle_Irons01.jpg">angle
irons</a>, so I can bolt together the bottom and side portions of my
chassis.
With 20 days to go after that, I'll have a decent chance of finishing
everything
by the end of the month.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; It's almost
5:30AM,
and I just finished drawing the bottom row of guiding dots on my left
panel.
These dots will be used to draw the vertical lines of the grid. I
couldn't
place the ruler on the bottom edge of the aluminum, since that would
mean
drawing the dots on top of the bottom of the flame pattern, and then
pressing
the ruler against of the flames to draw the vertical lines. This could
scratch off some of the flames, so I was forced to place the ruler <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LP_Ruler_Middle.jpg">on
the bottom of the blank space</a> instead. Doing this raised the
millimeter
lines on the ruler above the panel, so it was impossible to draw the
dots
perfectly spaced apart. Because of this, the lines may turn out crooked
as I draw the grid. Anyways, I'm off to bed, and I'll let the dots sit
and dry until I get back in the afternoon.</font></font> </p>

  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/4/2004 - Last
night,
I started what I had hoped to be the last session of work on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2702.jpg">side
panel</a> before applying the lacquer to it to make the paint job
permanent.
I still had the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2701.jpg">cardboard
taped to the panel</a>, and I could squeeze the sides of the cardboard
to bend it slightly in an arc, so that I could see some of the paint
job
underneath. I set up the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Desk_Lamp.jpg">desk
lamp</a> so I could better see the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2702.jpg">rectangular
window mark</a> I drew in pencil on the aluminum during the previous
session.
The next step was to erase everything within that rectangle to make
room
for the word "SYSTEM", and I was going to do that with the cardboard
frame
on. However, I felt it was more important to see rectangle clearly than
it was to provide the panel with maximum protection. So I decided to
remove
the cardboard cover earlier than I'd originally planned. I used a
toothpick
to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2703.jpg">scrape
off the inner parimeter</a> of the rectangle, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2704.jpg">scraped
away everything in the middle</a>. For some reason, the light green
square
was the toughest to scrape away; the toothpick only faded it a little
bit.
There was still a lot of Sharpie residue within the rectangle, so I
knew
I had to resort to a more drastic method. I covered the panel with the
cardboard frame without taping it on, fogged the rectangle with my
breath,
and then wiped the rectangle with a toothpick wrapped in a paper towel.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Now that I
had a clean
slate to paint "SYSTEM" on, the next step was to draw the guiding grid
within the rectangle, so I could later fill in the appropriate squares
with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pigma_Microns_01.jpg">Pigma
Micron 05 pens</a> to paint on the word. With the cardboard cover off,
I drew the horizontal midline in the now blank window, following the
already
existing squares on the left and right sides of the window. I then VERY
carefully positioned the cardboard cover back over the aluminum panel,
so that the midline lined up with its counterpart on the cover. I then
taped the two panels securely together, so they could not slide. I used
the lines on the cover to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2705.jpg">draw
the eight remaining horizontal lines</a> within the rectangle, and then
removed the cover to check my work. The top line was uneven; the left
side
was very close to the top of the rectangle. In fact it was so close, I
accidentally erased part of the line below the errant one, and it took
me about half an hour to make the fix. I drew the vertical lines using
the same interlacing pattern I used to draw the ones on the cover, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2706.jpg">odd
lines first</a>, and then the evens. After drawing all of the odd
lines,
I decided to take a break when I got caught up in about an hour of <a href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/cvss2/" target="_top">Capcom
vs. SNK 2</a>. When I got back, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2707.jpg">I
drew the even vertical lines</a> to finish the grid, and then paused
again
for dinner.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; After I had
finished
eating, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2708.jpg">I
removed the cardboard cover</a> from the aluminum panel, and began to
fill
the squares with the Microns to draw the word "SYSTEM". <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2709.jpg">The
first "S"</a> went without a hitch. However, right after I took the
pictures
of the S, the cord of my headphones brushed against the letter from
right
to left, smudging it a little. I quickly repaired the letter by erasing
the blank squares with a toothpick, and then redrawing the rest of the
squares their appropriate colors. I completed most of the letters by
painting
each one from left to right; first <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/S_Left_BG.jpg">drawing
the black space to the left of the letter</a>, then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/S_Green_Letter.jpg">drawing
the green letter itself</a>, and finally <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/S_Complete.jpg">filling
in the rest of the black areas</a> of the letter's square. When I got
to
the "T", there was a very thick vertical grid line that got me worried.
The line ran along the right of the T, and I had to consider each side
to be half of a square. With this in mind, I very carefully marked the
right edge of the T by filling in the left half of the line, and the
black
pixel to the bottom and to the right of the letter by filling the right
half of the line.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; When I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel03.jpg">finished
all six letters</a> in "SYSTEM", I was confident that that was the last
of the work I had to do on the side panel for a while. After I was done
admiring my work, I wrapped the panel in plastic so I could put it
away.
BIG mistake. Just as I was about to take the panel upstairs to my room
to put it away, I noticed the word "SYSTEM" was a little smudged.
Frantically
but carefully, I unwrapped the plastic, and every letter in the word
was
smudged! It took me about half an hour to fix the damage, and when I
was
finished, the letters looked almost as good as they did before. The
next
time I do a paint job like this, I will give the Pigma or Sharpie ink
at
least six hours to dry before wrapping it with anything. I'd like to
think
that this bad experience makes me one mistake smarter. Also, I'm never
going to wear headphones while painting again either. Another mistake
smarter,
I suppose. Anyways, I finished the painting session around two or three
this morning, and I spent the next two hours doing random searches on <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>
before going to bed.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; My parents
threw a
Fourth of July party today, and we had several guests over, including
my
sister Jennifer. When she arrived, she lent me her <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_Sharpies.jpg">dark
and light green Sharpie markers</a>. After I finish both painting side
panels, and all four <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>, I will give everything one last coat of Pigma and
Sharpie
ink, and then apply a coating of lacquer or polyurethane to everything,
officially finishing CES's paint job. But first, I'll have to buy some
lacquer and polyurethane, and test them on one of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Cutouts01.jpg">top
hatch aluminum scraps</a> to see which one better preserves a test

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/3/2004 - I began
work
on the protective cardboard frame for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel02.jpg">side
panel</a> yesterday, but I didn't get as much work done as I wanted to.
I found a nice, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction01.jpg">thin
piece of cardboard</a> in a small cabinet here in the kitchen. Using <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">my
pink mechanical pencil</a>, I first drew the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction02.jpg">cut
lines</a> in the cardboard to cut out a 4" x 7" section, the same size
as my side panels. I measured the aluminum panel to determine where the
word "SYSTEM" would go, which was just below the word "ENTERTAINMENT"
on
its left edge. From the upper-left corner of the panel, the upper-left
corner of "SYSTEM" turned out to be 25mm x 22mm, while the lower-right
corner was at 85mm x 32mm. I drew the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction03.jpg">window
cut lines</a> on the cardboard based on these measurements, so that the
resulting rectangle would be the same position on the cardboard as
"SYSTEM"
on the aluminum. After doing so, I saw my parents moving a bunch of
trees
to the backyard one branch at a time, so I took a break to assist them,
which took about an hour. After coming back, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction04.jpg">I
cut out the 4" x 7" section</a> of the cardboard cover.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I needed to
eventually
draw a guiding grid on the aluminum to draw "SYSTEM", and in order to
make
that task easier, I drew the 1mm grid lines on the cardboard, but this
was far more tedious that you might think. I began with the guide dots
for the vertical lines, and there were about 60 of them to draw, all
1mm
apart. I used <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> to attach my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">ruler</a>
securely <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES01_Ruler_Top.jpg">to
the top of the cardboard sheet</a>, and then careful drew the dots.
When
all the dots were drawn on the top of the sheet, I repeated the process
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES01_Ruler_Bottom.jpg">on
the bottom of the sheet</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/ES01_Ruler_Middle.jpg">at
the bottom edge of the 6cm x 1cm rectangle</a>. I then drew the dots
for
the horizontal lines on the sides of the sheet. There were only nine
dots
on each side, so I didn't need to tape on the ruler. By the time I got
around to drawing the grid lines on the cardboard, it was already
night.
I began drawing the vertical lines through the future window. I drew
the
lines in an interlacing pattern; <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction05.jpg">drawing
every other line</a>, and then drawing the ones I had skipped (odds,
then
evens). However, I got so bored drawing all those lines, that I found
myself
Web surfing for a few hours. Despite this distraction, I eventually did
finish the odd-number lines. When I was about two thirds done with the
even-numbered lines, my parents began to watch Harry Potter and the
Chamber
of Secrets, so I decided to join them. When the movie was over, it was
about 1AM. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction06.jpg">I
drew the rest of the vertical lines</a>, and then it was easy to draw
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction07.jpg">nine
long horizontal lines</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Once all the
lines
were drawn, I used my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Eraser_Shield01_Construction08.jpg">cut
out the 6cm x 1cm window</a> in the cardboard, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2701.jpg">placed
the window over where "SYSTEM" should go</a> on the side panel. The
window
didn't line up exactly with "SYSTEM", so I had to push the cardboard
panel
slightly up and to the right. I then marked the parimeter of the window
on the aluminum sheet, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Right_Panel_%27System%2702.jpg">took
off the cardboard</a> to get a good look at the mark. It was exactly in
the right position, and so I put the cardboard back exactly the way it
was before, and then taped it in place.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Today, I'm
going to
try to find a way to erase the Sharpie marks within the window, so I
can
then draw the word "SYSTEM" in its place. Hopefully, I'll get a lot of
work done today without all of the distractions. It's just after
5:30PM,
so there's still time to finish the panel today.</font></font> </p>

  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/2/2004 - I think
I
may have found a solution on how to paint the word "SYSTEM" on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel02.jpg">side
panel</a> without stripping any paint that's not supposed to come off.
I could build a cardboard protective frame that would be the same size
as the side panel, and cut a 6cm x 1cm window in the cardboard where
"SYSTEM"
will be on the aluminum. I would start with a thin piece of cardboard,
cut it down to the size of the side panel, mark both cut lines for the
window and grid guide lines for the letters, cut out the window, and
then
tape the cardboard over the aluminum. If I measure the window
correctly,
it should expose the exact spot where "SYSTEM" should be. Then, I will
erase all of the Sharpie ink that shows through the window, and then
use
the grid guide lines to draw the grid, and hope that this new grid
lines
up with the one I used to paint "THE CREAMY ENTERTAINMENT". I will then
use the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pigma_Microns_01.jpg" target="_top">Pigma
Microns</a> to paint in the word as usual. My only hope is that I can

enough time between my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certification/a/default.asp" target="_top">A+</a>

plenty
of hours in the day to make it happen.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">6/29/2004 - At
around
6PM last night, I continued to work on painting the top two rows of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Right_Panel02.gif">CES's
name</a> on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name07.jpg">side
panel</a> with my new <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Green.jpg">green</a>
Pigma Micron pens. I completed painting the word "<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name08.jpg">ENTERTAINMENT</a>",
which spanned the entire length of the name's parimeter in the middle
row,
and this gave me an extra reference when painting the top row of
letters. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name09.jpg">I
painted the "E"</a> in the word "THE", and then spent the next two
hours
painting the word "<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name12.jpg">CREAMY</a>".
I did have a few slip-ups while completing the letters that day, but
nothing
too serious. After the top two rows of letters were completed, my panel
read "THE CREAMY ENTERTAINMENT", and I used a black Sharpie to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name13.jpg">fill
in the empty spaces</a>; the space between "THE" and "CREAMY", and
whatever
was to the right of "CREAMY". The Sharpie marks didn't look like the
same
shade of black as the black from the Micron, but I assumed this would
correct
itself once all the ink dried. However, nearly 24 hours later, the ink
is all dry, and the blacks from the two pens still don't match. I may
someday
end up scratching off the Sharpie ink on the top of the panel and
replace
it with Micron ink.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel02.jpg">I
took the protective paper towel off of the panel</a>, and got a good
look
at what my panel would look like when completed. I noticed a lot of
tiny
missing areas in the flames, so I took the black Sharpie and filled
them
in. Even though I was done for the night, I still had one final step to
go before the panel could be considered finished; painting the word
"SYSTEM"
on the bottom row. This would not be easy, as I would have a lot of
problems
to overcome. I will have to remove the existing flame pattern in the
6cm
x 1cm area where "SYSTEM" will be before painting over that area.
Normally,
I would draw guiding lines on the panel to make a box which would tell
me the position and size of the "SYSTEM" space, but doing so would ruin
the paintjob of the flames and the letters. Also, I have to think of a
way to remove the paint without scratching the panel. Once the Sharpie
ink is gone from the section, I'll have to draw a grid of 1 sq mm lines
which line up with the letters on the top two rows, so "SYSTEM" does
not
look crooked below the other words. And on top of all that, I have to
somehow
protect the entire panel so my hands don't smudge the ink.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">6/28/2004 - At
around
6 or 7 AM yesterday, I began to apply color to my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name02.jpg">side
panel</a>. I began by figuring out where the name should go on the top
of the panel. I decided to put the left-most portion of the letters
25mm
right of the left edge of the panel, instead of 20mm as in my original
plans. This way, there would be some space between the left 4" angle
iron
and the left edge of the letters. I used the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black
Pigma Micron 05</a> to draw a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name03.jpg">130mm
x 20mm border</a> around the area where I planned to draw the letters.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Once the
border was
in place, I got started on the letters, which were 10x10 pixels each. I
brought <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
down to the kitchen, and with <a href="http://www.jasc.com/products/paintshoppro/?" target="_top">Paint
Shop Pro 4</a>, I opened the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/CES_Name/Right_Panel02.gif">CES
name image</a> and zoomed in 10:1 so I could more easily copy the
pattern
from digital to aluminum. I began with the letter "T" of the word "THE"
in the upper-left corner of the image, but once again I got off to a
rocky
start. I misread the true size of the pixels twice, causing me to first
draw the T eight pixels wide instead of six, and then to make the
horizontal
part of the T two pixels thick instead of one. In order to erase the
errant
pixels, I fog-breathed on them and then wiped them off with a paper
towel.
When I turned on PSP's grid feature, the positions of the pixels became
a lot clearer.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Once the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name04.jpg">T
was finished</a> sans the dark green ink I didn't yet have, I drew the
"E" below it in the word "ENTERTAINMENT". After I drew the light green
part of the "E", I was in the process of inking the black pixels at the
bottom of the letter when I unexpectantly ran out of room on the bottom
and fell a row of pixels short. At first, I thought I might have
accidentally
put an extra pixel of space between the T and E, but looking closer I
found
that I had made the T one pixel too long. In order to fix this, I had
to
erase the bottom two pixels of the T, and then painstakingly brought
everything
below the bottom of the T up one pixel, which meant a lot of fog breath
erasing and redrawing. The toughest part about redrawing the pixels was
that whenever I erased errant pixels, the portion of the grid under it
would often fade considerably. This meant whenever I drew over a
portion
I had just erased, I had to strain my eyes that much harder to see the
grid so I could put the pixels in the right places. However, I
discovered
that using a toothpick is an effective way of erasing smaller errors,
because
the small tip means I can erase an error more accurately, the error
rubs
off more neatly, and the grid doesn't fade as much as with the fog and
wipe technique.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Around
12:30AM, my
mother brought down <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Desk_Lamp.jpg">her
desk lamp</a> so I could see what I was doing more clearly. This would
also use less electricity that having all four ceiling lights above the
table on. The lamp made the grid a lot clearer, especially when I had
to
draw over partially erased section of grid from an earlier error.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The next
letter I
drew was the "H" of "THE", but I then decided it would be best if I
first
completed "ENTERTAINMENT" in the middle row. The space between "THE"
and
"CREAMY" could cause certain problems when positioning the C, so I
figured
that I could use "ENTERTAINMENT" as a guide to get the correct position
on the word "CREAMY". I made it all the way up to the second "N", so
when
I finally called it a "night" at around six this morning, my panel read
"<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name07.jpg">TH
ENTERTAIN</a>". The technique I used for most of the letters was to
first
position a 10 x 10 pixel marquee around the letter in the CES gif. I
would
then copy the isolated letter by drawing the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/C_Unfilled.jpg">black
negative space</a> around the letter, and then drawing in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/C_Filled.jpg">light
green letter</a> itself. I would have then drawn the dark green halo
around
the letter if I had a hunter green Pigma Micron on me, but that will
have
to wait another couple weeks for <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a> to restock those pens. The last thing I did before heading
off
to bed was give the drying green letters another coat of ink, since
they
were starting to look faded. I plan to do some further work on the
panel
as son as I finish typing out this report, and I'll report today's
session
sometime tomorrow.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">6/27/2004 - I
continued
working on painting one of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Side_Panels01.jpg">CES's
side panels</a> during this morning's pre-dawn hours. But before I
started
to work on the actual panels, I decided to give my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pigma_Microns_01.jpg">Pigma
Micron 05 markers</a> a quick round of tests. On one of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Cutouts01.jpg">aluminum
top hatch cut-outs</a>, I drew a series of dots 1/16" apart along the
top
and right edges with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Blue.jpg">blue
Micron</a>. I blew on the marks a few times, and then lightly pressed
the
edge of my right hand against the marks. The marks partially came of on
my hand, but did not smudge. I drew a series of dots along the bottom
edge,
and began to use the top and bottom dots to draw vertical lines.
However,
I screwed up the lines early on, so I moved right on to another test. I
drew a small, solid square on the top-left corner of the panel, and
planned
to come back later to see if it would dry well.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I took one of
my side
panels still in its paper towel, four Microns, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pink_Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">my
pink mechanical pencil</a>, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">my
trusty ruler</a> to the kitchen to finally begin painting CES's name on
the panel. But before I began, I wrapped the paper towel around the
panel
to cover the green flames, so that only the unpainted top two
centimeters
were visible. My mother applied a piece of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> on the paper on either side of the panel while I held
everything
in place. Once the existing flames were <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Protected.jpg">protected</a>,
I used my pink pencil to make the line marks 1 millimeter along the
left
and right edges of the top 5" x 2cm section of the panel. The panel is
seven inches wide, but I set aside an inch on either side for 4" angle
irons which will cover the side panels. Once the marks were done, I
then
used the ruler to connect the dots, making the horizontal lines. The
lines
weren't as evenly spaced as I would have liked them to be, but it
should
still be good enough for the grid.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The vertical
lines
are proving to be far more difficult and tedious to draw than the
horizontal
ones. These lines were a lot shorter that the horizontals, but there
will
be a lot more of them when the grid is done. So when I made the line
marks
on the top and bottom edges, I had to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/RtP_Measurement_Top.jpg">tape
the ruler in place</a> to keep it from slipping as I made the marks.
After <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name01.jpg">completing
the marks</a>, I started to draw the vertical lines. The toughest part
was working around the existing vertical lines which were 5mm apart,
because
they weren't exactly even, and I made the mistake of assuming they
were.
So I had to draw new lines over them to make the correction. The
existing
lines were already quite a bit faded, especially at the edges, so it
was
easy to tell them apart from the new lines. Around five or six in the
morning,
I completed the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Right_Panel_Name02.jpg">first
5cm of vertical lines</a> on the left side before heading off to bed.
Today,
I plan to complete the grid, and then fill in the squares for the black
and light green pixels. The dark green pixels will have to wait until I
can get my hands on a hunter green Pigma Micron 05 pen, hopefully in
two
weeks time.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; It's almost
7:30PM,
and I just finished drawing the grid of 1mm squares on my side panel,
but
I didn't have an easy time. The pencil line marks became hard to see
and
quite frankly I didn't trust them. So I began using my black Micron to
draw the marks, which made my job easier. But still, the marks were a
little
crooked, so I had to compensate when drawing the lines. Some lines
turned
out crooked, so I had to redraw them. The grid was too small to erase
any
wayward lines, so I was forced to just draw over them and I hope I
don't
follow the wrong lines when I fill the grid with the Microns.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; By the way,
the blue
test square I drew this morning is now dry. About an hour after I first
drew it, I pressed on it lightly with the edge of my hand, and the ink
didn't come off. But when I pressed harder, only a little ink ended up
on my hand. Now, the square still looks solid and un-faded, and the ink
no longer comes off. I'd say that the Microns have passed the smudge
test.</font></font> </p>

afternoon,
I went to our local <a href="http://www.pearlpaint.com/" target="_top">Pearl
Paint</a> on Route 17 to pick up some <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/pigmamicron/pigmamicron.html" target="_top">Pigma
Micron markers</a>. These are fine-point markers that can write on
aluminum
pretty clearly and not smudge as badly as many other markers.
Fortunately,
the markers came in a variety of colors as I'd hoped, but a lot of the
colors I needed were sold out. There were many tip sizes, the smallest
being 005. The best I could do was to buy a pack of six 05 markers,
which
had four of the colors I need to paint the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Side_Panels01.jpg">sides
of CES</a>. I now have <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black</a>,
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Green.jpg">light
green</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Red.jpg">red</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Brown.jpg">light
brown</a>, but I still need white, dark green, and yellow markers. It's
a good thing that the set included a black pen, because I left my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/PM02_Black.jpg">black
Micron 02 pen</a> in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>.
According to the cashier I talked to, the markers should be restocked
in
about two weeks, so I'll return to pick them up then. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Pigma_Microns_01.jpg">The
markers</a> cost me $13.57, but because they will be used as a tool to
build my computer and won't be an actual part of it, the cost of the
markers
will not be factored into CES's budget. Even though I don't currently
have
all the colors I need to finish painting CES's side, I can still work
with
the pens I have, and then finish the job once I get the other three
colors.
As I was deciding which markers to buy, I tested two of them on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Cutouts01.jpg">aluminum
cut-out middle portions</a> of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch</a>, in order to see how the markers would smudge. I used a black
Micron to make a tiny mark on one of my aluminum pieces, and then
rubbed
the mark with the edge of my hand. I gentle rub didn't smudge the mark,
but a harder one nearly erased it. I figure that as long as I give any
marks I make with my new markers about a minute to dry before going
near
it, I can probably reduce the chance of the patterns smudging on my
side
panels.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Yesterday, I
picked
up my first, last, and only paycheck from </font></font><a href="http://www.freshobsessed.com/" target="_top"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"></font></font></a><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.apsupermarket.com/" target="_top">A&amp;P</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">,
for my training for a cashier job that I just wasn't cut out for. The
check
was for a little over $90; not bad for a job in which I didn't last for
much more than a week. I already have $28 in change sitting on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Creamy%27s_Dresser.jpg">tall
dresser</a>, and that cash will go towards the mounting rack for my
slimline
drives. The next time I can get to the bank, I will deposit $50 into my
diminishing account, and cash the rest. Then, I should be able to
afford
the mounting rack. Once I order and receive it, I will then try to
figure
out exactly how to mount it to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">CES's
bottom panel</a>.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">6/16/2004 - Last
night
and through the earliest hours of this morning, I was working on
finishing
the left door of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Doors02.jpg">top
hatch</a>. Leaving the protective tape on the aluminum panel, I placed
it on top of one of my two remaining <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Lexan_Sheets01.jpg">lexan
panels</a>, which was still protected by the paper that it was shipped
with. I held the two panels together with about five or six pieces of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">Scotch
tape</a> in order to keep the panels from slipping apart as I drilled.
I then began drilling through the drill holes already in the aluminum
panel,
and continuing to drill through the lexan. As I was drilling the first
hinge hole, I noticed that the panels were slightly crooked, but
decided
to continue anyway. Once I had bolted on the hinges, they were <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Left_Hatch_Construction01.jpg">extremely
crooked</a>, and I ended up wasting the whole fucking lexan sheet.
Fortunately,
I still had the third lexan panel to fall back on. Using the same
procedure,
but being much more careful in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Left_Hatch_Construction03.jpg">lining
up the panels</a>, I repeated the process. This time however, the
hinges,
and everything else went on straight, and I was pleased with <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Left_Hatch_Construction04.jpg">the
result</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; After all the
holes
were drilled in the lexan sheet, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Left_Hatch_Panels01.jpg">I
separated the left door's two panels</a> by removing the bolts and
Scotch
tape. I then peeled off all the tape from the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/LtH_Panel_Dirty.jpg">aluminum
sheet</a>, took the panel to the slop sink and, using lots of soap and
a small scrubber, scrubbed away as much of the masking tape residue as
I could. After the aluminum panel was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/LtH_Panel_Clean.jpg">clean</a>,
and I peeled off the protective tape from the lexan sheet, I put the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Left_Hatch_Panels02.jpg">two
panels</a> back together and very carefully bolted the hinges, knob,
and
roller catch back into place. Finally, I had CES's entire top hatch <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Doors03.jpg">completed</a>.
As a final step, I went into the garage and recovered <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Screw_Drawers01.jpg">some
drawers</a> which contained some screws, bolts, and nuts. After a bit
of
searching, and found a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Steel_Nuts.jpg">matching
pair of nuts</a> which fit the fastening screws for the top hatch's
brass
knobs. I removed the knobs from the top hatch by separating the knobs
from
their fastening screws, placed the nuts onto the screws, put the screws
back into the panels, and fastened the knobs onto the other side of the
screws. I then sandwiched the panels in between the knobs and nuts
tightly.
The result was that the knobs were fixed a lot more tightly than the
nuts
on the other side of the panels.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Because the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Cutouts01.jpg">middle
sections</a> of the aluminum panels were removed in the creation of the
hatch doors, three and a half ounces were shaved off of the total
weight
of CES. The official weight was 9 lbs, 2.5 ounces before I cut out the
middle of the panels, so now the official weight of CES becomes 8 lbs,
15 ounces. The heaviest item left to add to CES's weight is now the <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/viaepiav1000a.html" target="_top">Via
Epia V10000A motherboard</a> I have yet to buy, and that weighs a
little
over half a pound. With still more weight to chop out of the chassis to
accommodate the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Hinges.jpg">top
hatch hinges</a> and the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hard_Drive_Coolers.jpg">fans</a>,
I think I still have a very good shot at staying under the ten pound
limit.</font></font> </p>
