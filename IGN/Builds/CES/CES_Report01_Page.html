<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/27/2003 - I
just
came up with a change in design for my custom made power button. The <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/LipStick_Cap03.jpg">lipstick
cap</a> will now be mounted within a tube that will be a lot shorter
and
slightly fatter than the cap. The washer on the cap will be mounted
further
back, behind the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top02.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a>, instead of within it. Instead of having two copper
plates
behind the front panel with the power wires welded to them, a second
washer
will be attached to the edge of the short tube. Instead of being
soldered
to two copper plates, the motherboard wires will now each be soldered
to
one of the washers. When the lipstick cap is pushed in, its washer will
touch the one on the short tube, and the computer should turn on and
off.
There should be three advantages to this design change. First, the
button
is now more reliable, because instead of having two contact points
being
bridged by a third, two contact points will now touch each other
directly.
Second, it will now be easier to remove the front panel from the
chassis.
This is because in the old design, the copper plates were going to be
soldered
to the front panel, and removing the panel meant taking the motherboard
wires with it. This can now be avoided, because the motherboard wires
will
now be soldered to the button. Third and finally, I can now finish and
test the button without having to finish the front panel first. As for
the short tube I plan to use, I have my eye on a cardboard spool of
kite
string that's exactly the right width for my button. If I get my
mother's
approval, I'll remove the string, cut down the length, and glue a plug
to one end of it.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; A few days
ago, I
planned to use a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Soap_Pump03.jpg">soap
pump</a> as my reset button, but since I couldn't find a practical way
to make it work, I decided to abandon the idea. However, this morning's
redesign of my power button made me give the pump a second look. I took
the pump out of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Soap_Bottle.jpg">the
bottle</a>, and removed the plastic tube, ball bearing, and top. My
plan
is to screw the top of the pump to a mount on the inside of the case.
Like
the power switch, the pump will have two washers mounted on it, each
attached
to a power wire. When the bottom of the pump is pushed inward, the two
washers will touch, completing the circuit. (I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/Reset_Button01.jpg">originally
planned</a> to glue the top of the pump's bottle to the front panel,
and
then use pump's screw-top to screw it in place. But this would have
forced
the contact washers to be outside the chassis. I tried to fix the
design
by encasing the washers in a tube, but the design became too complex
and
impractical, so I abandoned the soap pump idea.) The bottom of the pump
is not smooth, so it's uncomfortable to push down on. To fix this, I
covered
it with the cap of a mechanical pencil. The two washers I plan to use
are
exactly the same size. They fit perfectly into the moving part of the
pump,
but I'll have to bore the hole on one of them slightly wider in order
to
fit onto the stationary part. The only thing I really have to do once
the
washers are in place is to buy a power cable and solder its wires onto
the washers. My brother Peter is visiting for Thanksgiving, and he
offered
a few alternate switch designs, including mounting the soap pump on its
opposite end, an idea I had already considered and discarded. But I
think
my current designs are just fine, and that's what I plan to use. No
offense,
Peter.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/25/2003 - Early
this
morning, I was comparing a computer's reset button to a dead man's
switch
in my head. This made me realize that a reset button has a definite on
and a definite off position, as opposed to a power button, which is a
momentary
contact switch. Knowing this, I thought I might be able to fit my
computer's
reset button with a wall switch, and use it as the computer's main
power
switch. However, a call to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
later that night convinced me it wouldn't be such a good idea.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/24/2003 - Early
this
afternoon, I was rummaging through my parents' bedroom drawers, and a
few
things caught my eye as stuff I could use for my computer's front
panel.
I found the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/LipStick_Cap03.jpg">cap
to a lost tube of lipstick</a>, an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Medicine_Bottle03.jpg">empty
medicine bottle</a>, and a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pretty_Button.jpg">really
beautiful button</a>. I saw potential in the cap and the button, so I
took
those with me. When I went to the garage to return the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Wall_Switch04.jpg">wall
switch</a>, I found a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Copper_Spring03.jpg">mid-sized
copper spring</a>, which fit into the lipstick cap perfectly. After my
parents got back from <a href="http://www.costco.com/" target="_top">Costco</a>,
my mother let me take the cap, but not the button, which I think would
have made a good looking reset button.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I had a
pretty good
idea about how to make a power switch with <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button_Parts01.jpg">the
materials I had on hand</a>, and decided to simulate making one. So I
put
together a model of my future power switch using cardboard to stand in
for the front panel and electrical connections. From the experiment, I
figured out how to make the final version of the switch. First, I'll
fit
the lipstick cap with a copper washer, gluing it on if necessary. I'll
then hot glue a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top02.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a> to a hole in the front panel. (This is the same type of
bottle top I'll use to mount the Pepsi cap on for the lampshade for my
power LED.) There will be two tiny copper plates mounted to the back of
the front panel, just over the power switch hole. These copper plates
can
also be paper clips. One motherboard power switch wire will be attached
to each plate. The plates can't touch each other, since that would
defeat
the purpose of the switch. The next step will be to hot glue one end of
the copper spring to the inside of the lipstick cap, in order to ensure
it never comes out by accident. The other end of the spring will be
fastened
to a special fixture inside the case. Finally, I'll put the front panel
into place, so that the Pepsi bottle top fits around the lipstick cap,
and encases the washer. If everything has been done right, pushing in
the
cap will cause the copper washer to bridge the gap between the two
copper
plates, and turn the computer on and off.</font></font> </p>

found <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/PS2_Cables02.jpg">two
PS/2 extension cables</a> in my sister's old bedroom. These cables will
be used to connect the mouse and keyboard PS/2 ports at the back of my
computer's chassis to the front panel. I feel that being able to plug
interface
devices into the front of the computer will give it more of a gaming
console
feel. I'll eventually have to find a way to solidly mount two PS/2
female
connectors to the front of the computer. Online, I found USB2.0
extension cables on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>
for two bucks each. I was pleased to discover the <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/store/default.asp?c=2#p3" target="_top">Via

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Three days
ago, when
I was searching the garage for light bulbs, I came across a really neat
looking <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Wall_Switch04.jpg">red
and cream wall switch</a> that I figured could be used as a my
computer's
on/off switch. Again, I called <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
for his advice, and he said that such a switch would not make an ideal
power switch for a PC. He said that while a typical wall switch has a
definite
on and a definite off position, a PC uses something called a momentary
contact switch, in which each completion of an electrical circuit turns
the computer on or off. So I'll have to return the wall switch to the
garage
and find some other non-conventional means of turning on and turning
off
my computer. Maybe I can modify a soap pump, or just buy something
online.</font></font> </p>

that I'm able to do further work on this project after all. Weeks
before
I began designing my chassis, I noticed a transparency in some <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Cap_Basic.jpg">Pepsi

rubber

caps, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Caps03.jpg">removed

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Today, I
figured out
how to put my modified Pepsi cap to use on my computer's front panel. I
took a look at the inside of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>,
and remembered something I learned in my </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certification/a/default.asp" target="_top">A+
Certification</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> class at <a href="http://www.fdu.edu/" target="_top">FDU</a>.
There is one particular set of pins on the motherboard that distributes
power to its components. These components include the LED lights, and
the
on-board speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I followed one of the cables from
the
set of pins, I noticed it lead directly to one of the LED's on the
computer's
front panel. I then figured that getting my Pepsi cap light to work
would
be a simple matter of taking a motherboard cable, stripping the sheath
off of the light end,&nbsp; soldering the exposed wires to a tiny light
bulb socket, screwing a bulb to the socket, then turning on the PC. If
the light works, I can then hot glue the top of a Pepsi bottle to the
chassis'
front panel, push the light bulb into the bottle top, then screw on the
cap. Tomorrow, I'll ask my brother-in-law <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
if he has any spare motherboard power cables, so I can test to see if a
small bulb can actually be used as a motherboard LED light.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/19/2003 - After
I
established the dimensions of my chassis, and that everything would fit
into it, my next concern was to keep the weight of the computer under
10
pounds, chassis and all. After weighing my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Floppy02.jpg">broken
floppy drive</a>, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive01.jpg">broken
hard drive</a>, and <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_CD_Drive02.jpg">possibly
broken CD drive</a> (almost 3 pound total), I estimated that all the
components,
including an additional hard drive and a small
power supply, would be 6 pounds tops. This left only 4 pounds for a
12" x 12" x 4" chassis. If I can replace the current internal power
supply
with an external PW-70 power supply, I can not only take 2 pounds out
of
the computer, but I can also give the finished product more of a gaming
console feel to it.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; If I can pull
it off,
my chassis will have a titanium skeleton consisting of 16 L-shaped
beams
(ten 12" long beams and six 4" beams), which will be 144 square inches
(12 square feet) in total length, and will weigh maybe 2 pounds. If I
decide
to go with a PW-70
as my power source (internal components now totaling 4 pounds), and add
a 2 pound chassis skeleton, I will have 4 pounds left to distribute
throughout
the rest of my chassis. My 12" x 12" x 4" chassis will have a surface
area
of 480 square inches, and will consist of six panels; the bottom panel
and top access hatch will be a square foot each (144 sq in), and the
other
panels will be 12" x 4" (48 sq in). This means the bottom panel and top
access hatch can weigh up to 1.2 pounds each, and each side panel can
weigh
up to 0.4 pounds.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I just
realized that
the top-middle beam may not be such a good idea for my chassis'
skeleton.
The chassis will open from the top, and the top-middle beam would get
in
the way should I decide to make any upgrades to my computer. Removing
this
beam will take a foot off the length of titanium I'll need to build the
skeleton, so I'll end up only using 132 inches (11 feet) of titanium.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Removing the
foot-long
top beam will take one sixth of a pound off the weight of the skeleton.
I can also take an additional pound out of the inside of the computer
by
replacing the IDE CD drive with a <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/store/default.asp?c=5#p277" target="_top">laptop
CD drive</a>. This new CD drive, the floppy drive, and the two hard
drives
will weigh around 3 pounds altogether, while the chassis' skeleton will
weigh around 1 5/6 pounds. However, just to play it safe, I'm still
giving
the skeleton a limit of 2 pounds. With 5 pounds left to build the
frame,
I can now make the bottom panel and top hatch 1.5 pounds each, while
each
side panel can weigh half a pound.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; So far, I've
come
up with a basic design for my chassis, made sure all its components
will
fit into it, and kept the total weight under my ten pound limit. I've
also
determined that the internal components might cost around $700. My next
goal is to actually start buying the parts for my computer, most
expensive
first. I will then lay the parts out on a 12" x 12" template, in order
to work out the details of the chassis' design. However, there are a
few
financial issues I'd like to work on before proceeding (paying back my
parents for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>,
opening a new savings account, and buying a new hard drive for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>),
and there's nothing more I can do on this project right now. So until I
get these issues resolved, I'm adjourning this project. The only thing
left to do now is clean up the mess I made in my room while getting the
project to this point.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/18/2003 - I've
been
spending the past few days searching the web for information that could
help me on the details of building my custom chassis. I found a new
motherboard
form factor called <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/" target="_top">mini-ITX</a>,
which is only 17 square centimeters, or 6.75 square inches. The
motherboard
is significantly smaller than the NLX I originally planned to use,
which
was 9" X 13". As you can imagine, this allowed me to make my chassis a
lot smaller than I could before. After doing some measuring with <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
(a currently unused computer I got from by </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certification/a/default.asp" target="_top">A+</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> prep class at <a href="http://www.fdu.edu/" target="_top">FDU</a>),
some obsolete components I took out of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>
ages ago, and my trusty <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">ruler</a>,
I decided to make the chassis 12" x 12" x 5".</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; When I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/SB16_Measurement02.jpg">measured
one of my soundcards</a>, I found it to be over five inches in height,
and this would have forced me to raise the height of my chassis. As
luck
would have it, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/store/default.asp?c=8#p50" target="_top">2
PCI slot riser card</a> on mini-itx.com. This not only allowed me to
keep
the chassis at its planned 5 inch height, but it would also provide me
with an second PCI slot, since the motherboard only comes with one. I
also
realised that stacking two CD drives and a floppy drive would not allow
the motherboard enough clearance to rest under the drives while mounted
on the spacers. So I cut back on one of the CD drive bays, sacrificing
expandability in order to avoid having to raise the chassis' height. As
a stroke of luck, taking out the drive bay gave me so much extra room,
that I could lower the height of my chassis to four inches. Then I
realised
that because the floppy drive bay was small enough to not have to pass
over the motherboard, this would give my motherboard still more
clearance,
leaving no doubt that I had enough room to work with.</font></font> </p>
