  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">2/3/2004 -
Yesterday,
received two packages in the mail. They were the items I ordered online
a week ago; <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_Packages.jpg">two
hard drive coolers</a>, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_Packages.jpg">two
green cold cathode fan grills</a>. I was busy cleaning the house
yesterday,
so I had to wait until today to open the boxes. So far, I only opened
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_Parcel.jpg">box
with the fan grills</a>, and they were a lot bigger than I imagined
them
to be. I decided to test one of the fans to see how well it would fit
inside
my chassis. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HDC_Fan&amp;Mount.jpg">took
one of the fans out of its mount</a>, and felt confident that it was
thin
enough to fit OK. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_Width_Comparison.jpg">compared
it's depth</a> to a box of toothpicks I'd been using as a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Fan_Space_Test02.jpg">stand-in
measuring prop</a> for my fan, and the fan was a lot thinner. I brought
my chassis parts down to the kitchen, and assembled the chassis minus
the
top and side panels. I also brought down my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/IDE_Cable.jpg">IDE</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Molex_Cable.jpg">Molex</a>
cords, plugged them into my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive01.jpg">broken
Maxtor hard drive</a>, and placed the drive where the real thing will
go
inside the chassis. When I put the fan <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_Positioning01.jpg">in
its place</a> behind the hard drive, I didn't notice any problems. I
then
put the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/HdD_On_HDC01.jpg">empty
fan mount under the hard drive</a>, but when I did that, the plugs kept
knocking the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a> down, so I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Chassis_Taped.jpg">taped
the panel and four-inch beams</a> to the rest of the chassis
temporarily.
There was just enough room for the fan to miss passing in front of the
Molex plug, just as I'd calculated through my experiments with the
toothpick
boxes. However, the IDE flat cord was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/IDE_Cable_Touching_Fan.jpg">just
being a total bitch</a>, constantly running into the fan, even though
there
was at least a full inch of space between them.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Putting the
hard drive
on top of the fan mount made me wonder if there would be enough
vertical
space for the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy
drive</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">slimline
CD drive</a> to fit on top of the hard drive, and still allow the top
hatch
to fully close. So I stacked the floppy drive and CD drive on the hard
drive, while the CD drive was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CD_Drive_In_FrP02.jpg">sticking
through its bay hole</a>. There was barely enough room to accommodate
all
three drives, and there could be no more than <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Drive_Stack_Zero_Clearance.jpg">zero
clearance</a> between them. So I put my two <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_AI.jpg">12"
top angle irons</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Front_Panel_Raised.jpg">under
the front panel</a>, raising it by a quarter-inch. I then used angle
iron
to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Drive_Stack_Clearance.jpg">separate
the three drives</a>, leaving an 1/8" inch of space between each one.
When
I then tried to adjust the drives horizontally, the hard drive slid off
of its mount. So I screwed the drive onto the mount, and this made
things
a lot easier for me.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I placed a
seven inch
beam vertically on the front-right corner of my chassis where a four
inch
beam would normally go. (I was using my two front four inch beams to
give
the floppy drive a 1/8" boost.) I then put the front panel in place
with
the CD drive in its bay, and slid it as far to the right as it would go
until the CD drive touched the 7" beam. I lined up the right edges of
the
floppy and hard drives to match that of the CD drive's. After that, I
put
the fan back into place. I figured I could get the fan as close to the
right edge of the back panel as possible without passing in front of
the
back-right corner vertical 4" beam, and have the only about the first
millimeter
of the fan to pass in front of the hard drive's Molex connector.
Because
the Molex would be plugged into the internal power supply, which will
be
placed in the opposite direction of the fan, the Molex cord will be
pulled
away from the fan, and not be an issue. I'm hoping the same will apply
to the IDE cord, but it's a little more tricky than the Molex. I
removed
the CD drive, floppy drive, and front panel in order to make room for
the
ruler, so I could measure the distance between the hard drive and the
fan.
It turned out to be about an inch, while the back of the IDE connector
was about 3/4" away from the fan. I don't know if this ultimately will
be enough space for my IDE cord, but I'm sure I'll find out later on in
the project.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Just now, at
11:45PM,
I discovered a bit of great news. I put the floppy and CD drives back
into
place without the beams separating them, put the front panel back over
the CD drive, and the 4" beams back onto the front corners. When the
front
panel reached as right as the CD drive would allow it to go, it was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/FrP_Between_AI.jpg">exactly
in between in corner beams</a>. This means I may not have to move the
front
panel CD bay hole after all. However, I may have to cut into the
back-right
beam in order to be able to move the fan to the right enough to miss
the
hard drive's Molex cord if necessary.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">2/1/2004 - Last
night,
I used my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green&amp;Black_Sharpies.jpg">Sharpie
permanent markers</a> to paint the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Left_Panel01.jpg">pixelated
flames</a> on my second side panel, and I didn't finish until two
o'clock
this morning. The job didn't go as smoothly this time around; I had two
slip-ups in which I had to use a wet paper towel to erase my mistakes,
redraw the sections of the grid, and the re-paint the correct colors
onto
the squares. The only paint-job I have left to do on my chassis now is
the four <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
beams</a>, which I plan to paint some of the bricks from one of the <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> games, once again using the Sharpies.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Just before
noon,
I called Jen and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
and said I would be ready to be picked up by two that afternoon. I
spent
my prep time trying to figure out the final details on how my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Top_Hatch_Panels02.jpg">top
hatch doors</a> would be hinged to my chassis. I figured out that I'd
cut
the tops off of my top-side 7" beams, since they would prevent the top
hatch from swinging open. I also figured out where on the beams to
mount
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dresser_Hinges01.jpg">hinges</a>,
and marked the bolt holes with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/PM02_Black.jpg">Pigma
Micron 02 pen</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; With only
half an
hour until my scheduled pick-up, I went to the garage, and brought in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Screw_Drawers01.jpg">two
drawers of screws and bolts</a>, in the hopes of finding some bolts I
could
use to mount the hinges to my top hatch and top-side beams. I had some
success, and as an added bonus, found <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Salvaged_Thumbscrews.jpg">three
thumbscrews</a>, but none of them matched. After I found <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Dresser_Hinges02.jpg">a
dozen potential bolts with matching nuts</a>, my sister arrived to pick
me up. She helped me in my search for some more nuts and bolts, then
when
we were ready, we headed off to her place.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I decided
last night
that I wasn't ready to assemble the entire chassis until everything was
painted, and I had my </font><font color="#ffffff"><a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/viaepiav1000a.html" target="_top">motherboard</a></font><font color="#993366">
and riser card, so that left me with just the top hatch. When I showed
JD the hinges I planned to use, he suggested that they may have been a
bit too heavy for my top hatch. I agreed with him, because when I
weighed
the hinges the night before on a kitchen scale, they turned out to be
11
ounces, adding almost a pound to CES. One of his suggestions for an
alternative
was a long hinge that's commonly used on pianos. If I can find a pair
of
those at the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1" target="_top">Home
Depot</a>, I'll buy them and use them for my top hatch.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; JD continued
the work
he had started on my top hatch last week. He used his Dremmel and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Right_Hatch_Cut02.jpg">cut
out the rest of the parameter</a> of one of the hatch panels. However,
he <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Broken_Dremel_Discs.jpg">broke
several drill bits</a> in the process. In my opinion, he did a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Right_Hatch_Cut03.jpg">pretty
good job</a> with the cut, but with the tools he had, he was unable to
cut off the corners of the window. An effort to do so with the Dremmel
would have cut outside the parameter, damaging the panel. At around
4:20,
JD said he had to start preparing dinner soon, so he gave me a crash
course
on how to use the Dremmel. After a few test cuts to get used to the
tool, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Left_Hatch_Dremel.jpg">I
began to cut out the window</a> of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Left_Hatch_Taping03.jpg">second
top hatch panel</a>. Just before I managed to cut through the first
edge
of the window, the drill bit shattered. Besides scaring the hell out of
me, the break left a piece of the drill bit <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Broken_Bit_Lodged.jpg">lodged
in the cut line</a>. After JD showed me how to replace the bit, I
continued
to cut. I was able to cut <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Left_Hatch_Cut02.jpg">two
more sides</a> of the D-shaped window parameter without a hitch. But
just
as I was about to finish the forth side, I lost my second drill bit.
Because
JD had showed me how to replace the broken bits, I followed that
procedure
and was able to continue with my third bit. After a short dinner break,
I returned to the workshop and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Left_Hatch_Cut03.jpg">cut
out the half-inch sections</a> of the jagged curves of the D. I wasn't
able to cut the corners with the Dremmel, but I guess I'll do that
another
time. Once the windows are cut out, I will use the side of the panels
with
the cut lines as the bottom of the hatch, because of the inevitable
scratches
caused by our Dremmel miss-cuts.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/31/2004 -
Yesterday
evening, I began painting the green pixelated flames on one of my 4" x
7" side panels. Before I began, I washed the panel with a soapy sponge,
because by that time I'd gotten a lot of fingerprints on it. I didn't
want
to get anymore fingerprints on the panel, so I searched the house for a
pair of thin cloth gloves I could wear, but came up empty handed. So I
called my mother in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>
to ask her where the gloves were kept, but she said that we were out of
them. After searching the under four different sinks in the upstairs
level,
I eventually found a used pair of rubber gloves. The smelt of
chemicals,
but I figured they'd keep my panel spot free. After about a half hour,
I found the gloves to be more trouble than they were worth, so I took
them
off and decided to take my chances with the fingerprints.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; In order to
get the
flames on my panel, I basically followed the same procedure I used on
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim10.jpg">scale
paper simulation</a> a month ago. I used my metal ruler to draw dots at
every 5mm around the parameter of the panel. I had to start over
several
times, because the ruler kept slipping out of place. After about an
hour
or so, I decided to tape one end of the ruler to the panel with masking
tape to hold it in place. After I drew all the dots on the exposed
panel,
I put a second piece of tape on the opposite end of the ruler, covering
some dots I already drew. I then removed the first piece of tape, and
drew
the dots where the first piece of tape was covering the panel. I
repeated
this process for the other three sides of the panel, and then used the
dots and my ruler to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Side_Panel_Flames01.jpg">draw
a grid</a>. Next, I pulled out the paper simulation of the green
flames,
and used it as a guide to copy the pattern onto the panel. I used <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green&amp;Black_Sharpies.jpg">three
Sharpie permanent markers</a> to do this; one <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Black_Sharpie.jpg">black</a>,
one <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dark_Green_Sharpie.jpg">dark
green</a>, and the other <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Light_Green_Sharpie.jpg">light
green</a>. Jen didn't have a white Sharpie for me to use, so I had to
leave
that color out. After several hours of ultra-delicate work, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Right_Panel01.jpg">finished
drawing the flames</a> at around five or six o'clock this morning. The
finished panel <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Panel_Flames_With_Sim.jpg">looks
like the simulation it's based on</a>, except with sharper colors and a
kickass reflective surface. I started working on the second panel this
afternoon. I've only gotten as far as finishing the grid, but after I
do
a bit of studying for my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certification/a/default.asp" target="_top">A+</a>
exam, I'll try to get the panel painted.</font></font> </p>

  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I'm heading
to <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
place again tomorrow, and I was originally planning to finish the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Top_Hatch_Panels02.jpg">top
hatch</a> of CES, and bolt together the chassis. But now that I've
given
a few matters some thought, I've decided not to bolt the chassis
together
just yet. There are two things I'd like to do before I put my chassis
together
permanently. First, I'd like to paint my other side panel with the same
green flame design as the first one. Second, I want to wait until I buy
the </font><font color="#ffffff"><a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/viaepiav1000a.html" target="_top">motherboard</a></font><font color="#993366">
and find the right riser card, so I can make the appropriate holes in
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a> before bolting it to the skeleton. I figure it would be a lot
easier to cut such holes in the panel when it doesn't have the rest of
the chassis in the way of any power tools JD and I might use. However,
I'm still going to do some work on the top panel. My plans are to cut
out
the windows of the top hatch panels, cut the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Lexan_Transparency.jpg">lexan
panels</a> to accommodate the top hatch <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dresser_Hinges01.jpg">hinges</a>,
bolt a lexan panel to the underside of each top hatch panel, cut the
ends
off the hinges to fit the hatch, and then bolt the hinges to the&nbsp;
panels. Then, I plan to cut off the tops of two of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">7"
beams</a>, bolt the beams to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_AI.jpg">12"
beams</a>,&nbsp; and bolt the panel's hinges to the inside ends of the
7" beams. If I can manage to remember to do so, I will weigh all of
CES's
chassis parts and drives using JD's scale. This will most likely be my
last visit to JD's house before I head down to Aventura to join my
parents.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/30/2004 - For
the
past week, I've been stumped on how to mount the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">two
switches</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">two
LEDs</a> to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Maxtor_Drive_Plate.jpg">switch
/ LED mounting plate</a> that will rest just behind the left side of my
front panel. This morning, I came up with a few possible solutions to
this
problem. The plate will be mounted about a quarter inch behind the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>. If I mount the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a> directly to it, the button will be too far behind the front
panel to reach with your average index finger. When I first discovered
this, I knew I would have to find some way of raising the button off
the
plate and closer to the front panel, but I could never figure out a
good
way to do this until recently. There will be two holes in the mounting
plate for the reset button; one hole for the switch itself, and a
smaller
screw hole. I think that if I find a bottle cap that's just the right
size,
I can cut a hole in it the size of the switch, then glue it over the
reset
switch hole on the mounting plate. This will hopefully let the reset
button
stick through its hole in the front panel, and still be mounted solidly
to the plate. But the button's screw hole will now be about a quarter
inch
away from its corresponding hole on the plate, so I'll need a longer
screw
to hold them together. The bottle cap's height will have to be the
difference
between the front of the reset button, and the back of the front panel
in order to make an effective mount.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I'm looking
at my
front panel right now, and I'm noticing that its two LED shades stick
out
of the back of the panel a little bit. This means my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED02.jpg">power</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED02.jpg">HDD</a>
LEDs would almost stick into their front panel shades if they were
mounted
directly to the mounting plate. However, this wouldn't be a good idea,
because the metal surface of the plate would cause a short circuit in
the
LEDs
and prevent them from functioning. So I'm going to have to mount the
LEDs
on a small and thin piece of plastic, and then attach it onto the
plate.
Finding such a mount isn't as easy as you think, because the
requirements
are very demanding. It can't be higher that a quarter inch, because
that
would go through the front panel. It can't be too wide, because it has
to fit between the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_Top03.jpg">Schweppes
bottle top</a> and the bottom of the chassis. Any cap that's round and
big enough to accommodate both LEDs will be too wide for this reason. A
third concern is the prongs on the red LED. When I was at <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
house last weekend and about to solder the red LED to its motherboard
cable,
JD asked me if I wanted to cut the prongs down to size. I declined,
because
I didn't think they would ever be a problem. Right now, I wish I had
cut
the prongs down when I had the chance, because their length will mean I
need a longer mount for the LEDs. And to make things still more
complicated,
I still don't know what part the front-bottom angle iron of my chassis
is going to play in this. So the best I can do for now is just gather
whatever
plastic caps or other pieces of plastic I think may be a potential
mount
for my LEDs, fit my chassis together, and just experiment from there.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/29/2004 - During
yesterday's
final hour, I did some more online shopping. I bought three different
items
from three different sites, things that will be built directly onto
different
parts of CES's chassis. As I mentioned last night, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>
sells a set of <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/thumbscrews.html" target="_top">ten
gold thumbscrews</a> for two dollars. It sounded like a good price,
that
is until the 6% New Jersey sales tax and the $4 <a href="http://www.fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a>
shipping were factored in. The total price was $6.11, a little too
steep
for my tastes, and my budget for that matter. So I'm going to go to
NewEgg
right now, and see if it's not too late to cancel. If I find that I'm
stuck
with it, I'll let my parents keep the seven bucks I put on the "<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Pay_Table.jpg">pay
table</a>", and just lick my wound and move on. (My parent's are
letting
me use their <a href="http://www.capitalone.com/indexrfa.php" target="_top">Capital
One</a> credit card for my online purchases. Every time I order
something
online, I put money on my mother's work desk to pay for the order. When
I go down to <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>
to join them on their vacation in a couple of weeks, I will take the
card
and the money with me, and pay them back for whatever I ordered.)</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I've got some
great
news. I went to NewEgg, typed in my username and password, went to my
order
status, and canceled my order. That's seven precious bucks I'll be
taking
back from the table, and will probably blow on some overpriced candy at
  </font></font><a href="http://www.freshobsessed.com/" target="_top"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"></font></font></a><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.apsupermarket.com/" target="_top">A&amp;P</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.freshobsessed.com/" target="_top"></a>.
At my next convenience, I'm going down to garage to see if my dad has
any
leftover thumbscrews that I can use. If not, I'll try to get some
really
nice looking ones at <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/" target="_top">Radio
Shack</a> or <a href="http://www.compusa.com/" target="_top">CompUSA</a>.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Another thing
I ordered
last night was a pair of hard
drive
coolers from <a href="http://www.hardwarecooling.com" target="_top">HardwareCooling.com</a>.
The coolers each come with a thin 80mm fan, one of which I will remove
from its housing mount at the back of my chassis. The fans were being
sold
for $4.99 a pop, totaling $9.98. However, I still had to pay around six
dollars for <a href="http://www.ups.com/" target="_top">UPS</a> to get
it here, so my total became $16.23. I chose UPS Ground, because it was
the cheapest means of delivery. I'm paying my parents $17 for the
order,
because I didn't want to go through the hassle of breaking a dollar.
Since
I the fans were $9.98 in my budget, and I ended up spending $17, which
is $7.02 added to the budget.</font></font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ffffff">$679.49 total
budget
+ $7.02 more spent = $686.51 total budget</font></font></p>
  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; My last order
of the
night was a pair of green cold cathode fan grills I bought from <a href="http://www.frozencpu.com/cgi-bin/frozencpu/index.html" target="_top">FrozenCPU.com</a>.
The grills were $13.50 altogether, but after a $7.32 charge for the UPS
Ground, the price became $20.82. I'm paying my parents an even $21 for
this order so that's $7.50 more than the $13.50 factored into my
shopping
list.</font></font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ffffff">$686.51 total
budget
+ $7.50 more spent = $694.01 total budget</font></font></p>
  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; However,
there was
a problem with the order. After I filled out the order form, I got an
error
message saying that I typed in the wrong discount code, even though
this
was optional and I typed none in. However, this seemed to empty my
basket,
but because of the discount code error, I thought this was just another
error related to the discount code. I filled out the form again, and
got
the same result. On a hunch, I went to my Tracking (order status) page,
and it told me I had ordered the pair of grills twice. There was no
apparent
way to cancel the order, so I wrote FrozenCPU a letter asking them to
cancel
one of my orders. I'm not adding this purchase to my budget twice,
because
I'm confident that the folks at FrozenCPU will clear up this whole mess.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I just
checked out
my order status at FrozenCPU.com to see if there was any change in my
order,
and it turns out that they had canceled one of the double orders, just
like I asked. The other order will be shipped soon, but I don't know
when
it will actually get here. When it does, I can then mount them on the
outside
of CES, exactly opposite to the thin fans inside.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/28/2004 - I just
finished
preparing the second top hatch door for cutting out its D-shaped window
frame. I followed the same procedure that <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
did last Sunday when I last visited his place. First, I put masking
tape
around the window's <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Left_Hatch_Taping01.jpg">outer
parameter</a>. The jagged curves of the frame were half inch lines, so
instead of laying down tape around that part of the parameter, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Left_Hatch_Taping02.jpg">covered
the jagged lines with tape diagonally</a>, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Left_Hatch_Taping03.jpg">cut
along the lines</a> with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>. The whole job took me a little less than an hour, primarily
because I kept stopping to take pictures for this project's photo log.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Yesterday, I
found
some <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/thumbscrews.html" target="_top">gold
colored thumbscrews</a> at <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>
for two bucks for a set of four. However, JD suggested I check out
NewEgg.com
during a phone conversation with him, so that's what I did. A good
thing
too, because <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg</a>
sold a package
of ten for two bucks. I'm going to buy the set right after I finish
this part of the log amongst other things, so I won't bother adding it
to the my Current Shopping List section of the budget.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Speaking of
NewEgg,
I also found some 120GB 7200RPM hard drives for even less than the $90
I was going to pay for one. It was around $81, but I forgot the exact
price.
Unfortunately, it sold out since I saw it, but the ETA is today, and
the
new price is $79. However, I won't put an exact price on the drive in
my
budget until I'm once again sure of exactly which drive I'm getting.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/26/2004 - This
is
continuation of yesterday's project log entry. There's really not much
else to add except that I forgot about the hard drive cover I planned
to
make into my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Maxtor_Drive_Plate.jpg">switch
/ LED mounting plate</a> until around 9PM, but by then it was too late
to start anything new. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since I can
just mark the rest of the cut lines on the drive cover, and cut cut
them
all at once on my next visit. Also, I apparently lost one of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">seven
inch angle irons</a>, but <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>

panel</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I just ran a
few tests
to see if the few electronic components I have so far for CES work. I
brought
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">LEDs</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">switches</a>
upstairs to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
and plugged it into the wall. I wanted to test if my switches still
worked,
so I unplugged Polyfragger's power switch, then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button_Test.jpg">plugged
my custom power switch in its place</a>. I pushed the button, and the
switch
still worked. I did have trouble activating the switch on a few
presses,
but I put my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top02.jpg">old
Pepsi bottle top</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Power_Button03.jpg">over
the switch</a>, and that got rid of the problem. I then replaced the
power
button with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a>. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_Test01.jpg">pushed
the button</a> several times, and it too worked just fine.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Then, it was
time
for my newly soldered LEDs to prove themselves. I unplugged
Polyfragger's
power LED plug, and was surprised when I saw that it had three pins
instead
of
two. Not sure if my two-pin LEDs would work on this motherboard, I
plugged
in my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED02.jpg">clear-shaded
red LED</a> in the two pins immediately to the left of the power switch
pins, and using my custom power button as the switch, turned on the
machine.
The LED blinked for about a half a second, and then just stayed off. At
first I was afraid I blew the LED, but turning the computer off and on
again produced the same result. I then moved the LED's plug over one
pin
to the left I turned the power on, but then the LED didn't work at all.
Then, I plugged the LED back in its original position, but this time I
reversed the pins. When I turned on the computer yet again, the LED
turned
on and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/HDD_Led_Test01.jpg">stayed
on</a>. I put the red cap of my front panel over the lit LED, and it
shone
through brightly. I noticed that if I put the LED halfway into the cap,
the red light dispersed throughout the cap, and that is the effect I'm
after. I turned the room's <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Ceiling_Fan.jpg">ceiling
light</a> off, and that made the LED seem to glow an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/HDD_Led_Test02.jpg">even
brighter red</a>. I put the cap over the LED again, and the LED's
effect
was even better. When I was done testing the red LED, it was time to do
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED02.jpg">the
green one</a>. I unplugged the red LED, plugged the green LED in its
place,
then powered on Polyfragger. The LED <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Power_Led_Test01.jpg">worked
OK</a>, but didn't glow as brightly as my red LED. When I put the front
panel's clear lipstick cap over the LED, the light <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Power_Led_Test02.jpg">didn't
disperse the way the red LED did</a> under the red cap. This is a small
disappointment, but if I can get a brighter green LED, it might look
better
under the clear cap. However, I'm keeping the LED I have for now, at
least
until I find something that's light years better than it.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/25/2004 - It's
nearly
1:30PM, and I'm expecting <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
to pick me up at any time now so I must type this out quickly. I spent
this morning working on getting the cut lines on my switch / LED
mounting
plate. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Maxtor_Drive_Plate.jpg">This
plate</a> used to be the cover for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive01.jpg">broken
Maxtor hard drive</a>, but now I'm putting to better use than just
lying
around doing nothing. I'm going to use this cover to mount my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel05.jpg">front
panel</a>'s switches and LEDs. It will be screwed to the front bottom,
left and top angle irons. It comes with its own screw holes, some of
which
I can use for the mounting. At first, I was gong to mount the cover on
its side, but its a few millimeters too wide, so my plan became to
mount
it vertically, then hack off whatever sticks above the vertical corner
beams. I took a piece of cardboard from one of the kitchen cabinets,
put
the drive cover <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drive_Cover_In_Corner.jpg">in
the corner</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drive_Cover_Traced.jpg">traced
the outline and screw holes</a>, then cut out a cardboard copy of the
cover.
I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate01.jpg">mounted
the cardboard simulation</a> to the left side of my chassis's skeleton,
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate02.jpg">taped
it</a> onto the front-bottom beam. I then removed the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_Cap.jpg">red
cap</a> from the front panel. The next I had to do was mark the cut
lines.
I put the front panel in place, and with my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">blue
mechanical pencil</a>, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate03.jpg">traced</a>
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_-_RsB_Hole_OK.jpg">reset
button hole</a> on the cardboard through the same hole on the panel,
then
made a small mark through the HDD LED hole. With the cardboard hard
drive
cover still taped to the beam, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Cardboard_Cut_Prep.jpg">rested
the beam over the edge of the table</a>, and put a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Tape_Dispenser.jpg">weighted
tape dispenser</a> on its right side to keep it from falling. I put a
cardboard-backed
yellow notepad under the left side to avoid damaging the table any
further.
Using my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/X-Acto_Knife.jpg">X-Acto
knife</a>, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate04.jpg">cut
out the hole</a> for the </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">.
Only one problem; the part where the reset will be mounted
is bigger than the button itself and round instead of rectangular, so I
was forced to make an adjustment to the hole. I took the beam and
cardboard
off the edge of the table, put the reset switch's face up against the
cardboard
so that its button poked through the hole, and traced the switch's
screw
hole, and conservatively guessed the cut lines of the round part of the
button. I then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Switch&amp;LED_Cardboard_Plate05.jpg">cut
along the new cut lines</a>, and then I was able to snake the reset
button
through the hole cord first, and push it into place. The hole was a
perfect
fit, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/RsB_Through_Cardboard01.jpg">held
the switch into place snugly</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I put the
bottom beam
back into place, and then put the front panel into its proper position.
The front panel's reset button hole was passed over the button
perfectly,
but there just one problem. The button was so far behind the hole that
it was impossible to push. Things weren't looking so good right then
and
there, but as I was easing the reset button out of the simulated
cardboard
plate, I noticed that after I pulled it out partially, it <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/RsB_Through_Cardboard04.jpg">stuck
in place</a>. On a hunch, I put the front panel back into place and
sure
enough, the button was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/RsB_Through_Cardboard03.jpg">closer
to its front panel hole</a>. It then hit me that I could mount some
kind
of corrective plate between the main plate and reset button, and this
could
make the button stick through the hole while still remaining firmly
held
to the main plate.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; After I
figured out
how I was going to mount the reset button, my next concern was the HDD
LED. I used a pin to poke a tiny starting hole through the spot I
marked
for the LED, and then used the pointed end of a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Compass.jpg">compass</a>
to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Compass_Through_Cardboard.jpg">bore
the hole wider</a>. I then pushed my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red_LED01.jpg">clear-shaded
red LED</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Mounting_Plate_Test02.jpg">through
the hole</a>, and positioned it so it would poke through the front
panel
about halfway. I noticed it jiggling a bit, but I think this can be
fixed
with some kind of corrective brace, maybe something short and tube-like.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Once I
figured out
where to drill the holes in the mounting plate, I removed its cardboard
simulation from the bottom beam, placed it against the real thing,
making
sure the drill hole marks on the cardboard matched the holes in the
drive
cover. I then used my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/PM02_Black.jpg">Pigma
Micron 02 pen</a> to draw through the cardboard cover's holes and
traced
those holes onto the drive cover. Now I'll know where to drill the
holes
for the reset button and HDD LED once I get to JD's house a little
later
today. After I put the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Bottle_Top03.jpg">Schweppes
bottle top</a> and the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Sawed-off_Lipstick_Cap.jpg">power
LED shade</a> in their places in the front panel, I will use them to
determine
where to put the holes for the button and LED.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Whooo, boy! I
just
got back from JD's house, and we managed to get quite a bit of work
done
on CES. JD has a workshop in his basement that is oriented around wood
work, but it proved to be good for working with aluminum as well. I
brought
a whole bunch of things for the visit, including the aluminum and lexan
parts for the chassis, my closet hinges, the LEDs and a few other
things.
I'd have to say that this one of the most productive days in my entire
project.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The first
thing we
did was solder the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green_LED01.jpg">power
LED</a> and the HDD LED to my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Cable03.jpg">second
motherboard cable</a>. JD used a pair of pliers to cut the cable in
half,
and then stripped them with the same pliers. The stripping was far
neater
than when I tried to do the same thing over a month ago with the cable
I used for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">my
switches</a>. Anyway, JD soldered the green LED that was going to be
the
power LED of CES to the first half of the motherboard cable, and showed
me step by step the basics of soldering. Apparently, you have to first
let the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Soldering_Iron.jpg">soldering
iron</a> heat up until it can melt solder. Then you have to melt a bit
of solder with the iron, and as the solder melts, it has to cover both
contact points (in this case, each LED prong and each wire), a process
called tinning. You then twist each wire to a contact point, making
sure
there is as much contact between the two as possible. It's best if the
contact points don't easily slide, and if the wire's twist gets to the
end of the contact point. Finally, the soldering iron is used to solder
the connections in place, and this causes the solder already on the
points
to melt and glue the points together. JD tinned the contacts for the
clear-shaded
red LED and the second half of the cable, but then I jumped in and
asked
to try the rest of the process first hand. JD suggested I attach the
red
wire to the LED prong closest to the flat side of the LED. (The flat
side
is almost impossible to see unless you're looking at it from the
correct
angle.) It took me a few attempts to twist the contact point right, but
I think I did a decent job for a first try. I soldered the two contact
points together, then repeated the process with the other two points. I
was very excited about seeing my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">first
LEDs</a> wired and ready to go, but I have yet to test them on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The next
thing I wanted
to do was to strengthen my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
switch</a> by replacing its <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Custom_Power_Cable02.jpg">flimsy
motherboard cable</a> with a much stronger <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Red&amp;Yellow_Cable.jpg">thick
copper red and yellow cable</a>. But when JD took a look at the cable,
he didn't think replacing power switch's motherboard cable was such a
good
idea. Apparently, a thin cable worked out pretty well for the switch
end,
because it could easily wrap around the contact points, but the copper
cable was too apparently thick to wrap around the points and stay in
place.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I remembered
something
I first noticed of a few days ago, but kept forgetting to tell JD about
it. One of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_AI.jpg">12"
angle irons</a> was a couple millimeters shorter than the other, and I
thought it might hinder my efforts when it came time to put the parts
together.
So JD cut the other three down to the length of the short one. Not only
were the beams brought to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Angle_Irons_Even.jpg">the
same length</a>, but the beams' edges looked a lot smoother too.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I wanted to
screw
all of the beams permanently into place, and JD's drill could certainly
do that just fine. However, I forgot to bring the right screws with me,
and the ones I brought were from the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dresser_Hinges01.jpg">hinges</a>
of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Creamy%27s_Dresser.jpg">my
dresser drawer</a>, and were good for wood, but the wrong kind for
aluminum.
JD didn't have nearly enough of the right screws for putting the
chassis
together either, so we were forced to skip this crucial step. Oh well,
maybe next time then. :(</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; JD and I may
not have
been able to assemble the chassis today, but we did get another crucial
step done. I've had the drill circles for the power button and power
LED
marked in my front panel for over a week, and now I finally had a
chance
to see them done. The circles were too thick to follow accurately, so
JD
had to guess the size of the drill bit to use for the power LED. He had
me use a large drill bit to find the center of the power LED cut
circle,
and when I felt confident that I had, he took over and hit the back of
the drill bit with some <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Wooden_Mallet.jpg">big
wooden mallet</a> several times until the hole poked through the back
of
the panel. He thought the best way to drill was through the back,
because
the protrusions in the back of the panel were uneven, and prevented the
panel from being laid down firmly on its back. So JD use his pair of
pliers
to take the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel_Border.jpg">border</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel06.jpg">off
the panel</a>, and this made it easier to work with. Then JD drilled
the
hole for the power LED, and I was immediately amazed at how easily the
drill chewed through the front panel's plastic. I spent several days
cutting
and chiseling some holes in my front panel making several mistakes and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel_Crack02.jpg">cracking
the panel</a>, and JD uses this drill to do the same thing in seconds,
making a perfect circle without the cracks. But the hole was too small,
because we decided to drill conservatively. So he then measured the
circumference
of the sawed-off lipstick cap that was to be my power LED shade, using
a slightly bigger drill bit to make the correction, and then the cap
fit
perfectly in the hole.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The same
process was
repeated with the Schweppes bottle top, but the bottom of it was much
wider
than the point where it connected to its widest ring. So JD <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drilling_PwB_Hole.jpg">drilled
a hole</a> in the front panel that was smaller than the bottom of the
bottle
top, but couldn't squeeze the top through the hole. He then used a
blade
which resembled a barber's straight razor to cut four slits in the
bottom
of the bottle top, but after that, he still couldn't fit the top
through.
Then, JD had what I consider to be a stroke up genius. He took the top
and panel upstairs, and at first I had no idea what for. He went to the
kitchen where there was a kettle on the boil, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Kettle_Steaming.jpg">put
the bottle top to the kettle's steam</a>. After about a minute, the
steam
melted the bottom of the top just enough for JD to squeeze it through
the
panel. In order to ensure the top didn't accidentally wiggle free, he
bent
the four slits outward to hold it firmly in place. The fit is <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Schweppes_Top_Through_FrP.jpg">pretty
damn solid</a>; no glue required.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The last
thing JD
and I did during today's visit was work on the top hatch windows. With
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Top_Hatch_Panels01.jpg">window
parameter marked</a>, it was easy to see what pattern I had in mind for
the windows. As a first step, JD put masking tape along the outer edge
of the window's parameter. The jagged curves were a little tricky, but
JD dealt with them by covering them with tape, then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Right_Hatch_Taped.jpg">cutting
out the stair pattern</a> with an X-Acto knife. Once the masking tape
protection
was in place, he then attempted to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/RtH_Initial_Cutting.jpg">cut
the inside edge</a> with some kind of drilling tool or something. The
tool
made a very loud, high-pitched whine, and I was forced to leave the
room,
and so I went upstairs to take a breather. After a while, JD came
upstairs
and said the tool he was using wasn't all that great for cutting out
the
window, and he had switched to a Dremmel instead. He had to stop after
one of the parts of the Dremmel broke as he worked, and this halted our
progress for the night. One edge of one of the hatch doors was cut <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Right_Hatch_Cut01.jpg">pretty
close to the edge</a>, but a lot more work will have to be done before
the patterns on the doors is cut out, let alone the lexan window and
hinges.
I have a little bit more to write on today's progress, but I'm way too
tired to continue, so I'll pick up the rest of today's events in
tomorrow's
log entry.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/24/2004 - It's
four
in the afternoon, and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
hasn't called to pick me up yet. I've spent the past few hours
preparing
for the visit. I've completed the cut lines for my top hatch windows. I
began by using graph paper to draw a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Blueprints_Hatch01.jpg">scaled-down
blueprint</a> of my top hatches, which included the windows and hinges.
Using my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">trusty
ruler</a> and my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Mechanical_Pencil.jpg">mechanical
pencil</a>, I marked every one inch point around the parameter, then
used
the marks to draw a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Cut_Lines01.jpg">grid</a>.
I then drew <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Cut_Lines02.jpg">half
inch mark lines</a> where the jagged curves of each D were. Then, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/TpH_Cut_Lines03.jpg">traced
the D-shaped pattern</a> with a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/PM02_Black.jpg">Pigma
Micron 02 pen</a>. The pen smudges fairly easily, so I had to wrap the
marked panels in the plastic that came with the aluminum.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The next
thing I did
to prepare was draw an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Blueprints_Top02.jpg">updated
blueprint</a> of the interior of CES. I had a bit of trouble
positioning
the drives, because I had forgotten that the angle iron adds a half
inch
to the length to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_05.jpg">chassis</a>.
The purpose of this blueprint is to gave JD a better idea of how I'm
planning
to design the inside of my computer. One of the changes I made to the
layout
of components is that the </font><font color="#ffffff"><a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/viaepiav1000a.html" target="_top">motherboard</a></font><font color="#993366">
is now mounted a full inch above the chassis floor. I felt that it
would
be better to have the I/O ports rest just above the back bottom angle
iron
instead of cutting into it. At first, I was worried that this might
block
one of the switches on my front panel, but I recently remembered that
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a> will be mounted in the middle of the left side of the
computer,
while the </font></font><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button04.jpg"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"></font></font></a><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button02_02.jpg">reset
button</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">
will be above it. However, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs01.jpg">LEDs</a>
will now have to be mounted below the motherboard in order to shine
through
their shades.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I recently
got off
the phone with JD, and we rescheduled out meeting for tomorrow at noon,
since it was six in the afternoon and too late to start anything. We
talked
about certain details of my build, and he brought up the issue of how
I'm
going to get to the screws to change drives if necessary. There will be
about an inch of space between my drives and the right side of the
chassis,
which is obviously not enough room for a screwdriver. I then came up
with
the idea that I can build a drive rack separately from my chassis, and
simply screw it in place. That way, if I need to change drives, I can
unscrew
the four easily accessible holes that hold the rack in place, take out
the rack, and have as much room as I need to unscrew the drive I want
to
change. Then, I can put the rack back into place the same way I took it
out.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Another thing
I mentioned
was my plan to melt a piece of the unused top half of my cart piece,
and
use it to seal a bit of the right side of my CD drive bay hole. JD
suggested
that this was something that was out of my league, and I'd never get it
to look right. But I think he might be wrong on this one, and after I
build
my drive rack, I'm going to attempt to move the bay hole on the next
fairly
warm day. It may not look as good as new, but neither do a lot of
things
about my front panel, and I haven't complained about those so why start
now?</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/23/2004 - While
Web
surfing yesterday morning, I found a hard
drive cooler at <a href="http://www.hardwarecooling.com/" target="_top">HardwareCooling.com</a>
for $4.99, which has a thin fan the same size as the one I was
originally
going to get from <a href="http://www.directron.com/" target="_top">Directron.com</a>
for $10.99. I plan to buy two of them, and use one to cool my hard
drive,
and the other as a case fan. I'm going to take the latter, unscrew its
fan, and attach it to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back
panel</a> behind the drives where the 25mm thick fan was to go. I will
mount the other cooler directly to the bottom of the chassis, and cut a
round fan hole in the chassis under the cooler. This way, the cooler
can
double up as a second case fan, which means I can buy a second green
cathode
grill, and use it to add even more green light to CES. Of course, this
means I'll have to get a set of feet for my chassis, but that's
something
I would have gotten anyway. This is a rather complex change in my
budget,
so I'll take this one one step at a time. First of all, since I'm
replacing
the 4 LED fan with a thin fan, I'm obviously not going to buy the LED
fan.
So $4.99 can come off the budget right away.</font></font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ffffff">$668.00 total

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; In place of
the 4
LED fan, I'm buying two hard drive coolers, one of which will be used
as
my&nbsp; back panel case fan. Each cooler costs $4.99, so both of them
cost a total of $9.98.</font></font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;$663.01

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Finally, the
cold
cathode green fan grills from <a href="http://www.frozencpu.com/cgi-bin/frozencpu/index.html" target="_top">FrozenCPU.com</a>.
One of these grills costs seven dollars, and so two of them would cost
$14. However, when you buy two of these grills from FrozenCPU, you get
a 50 cent discount. Since the two grills cost $13.50 together, and I
would
have paid $7 for just one, I'm spending $6.50 more for the two grills.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; This morning,
I checked
to see if it was possible to mount my floppy drive, so that it's
centered
beneath my slimline CD drive. Knowing that the <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com" target="_top">mini-itx</a>
form factor was 17 square centimeters, I put <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">my
ruler</a> in front of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Construction02_05.jpg">my
chassis</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drive_Positioning01.jpg">metric
side up</a>, spanning the length of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a>. I placed my broken hard drive in my chassis just to the
right
of the 170mm mark where the motherboard will be, but enough to the left
for its <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Molex_Cable.jpg">Molex
power connector</a> to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Fan_Space_Test02.jpg">not
pass in front of the slim fan</a>. I then carefully placed my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
slimline CD drive</a> outside the chassis, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drives_Centered01.jpg">centered
just in front of the hard drive</a>. The right edge CD drive <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Drive_Positioning02.jpg">barely
missed</a> the front right four inch beam of the chassis. Because the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy
drive</a> is the same size as the hard drive, and its smaller Berg
power
port gives more horizontal clearance that the hard drive's larger
Molex,
I knew that the hard drive being able to fit to the right of the
motherboard
while still not interfering with the fan, meant mounting the floppy
drive
directly over it would not interfere with the fan either. Mounting the
two drives directly on top of each other makes it easier to build the
mounting
frames, since it would only take two unbent frames (one on each side)
to
mount both drives. Centering the floppy drive under the CD drive will
make
the front panel look a little less crooked than if they were
off-center.
When I build the CD drive bay, it will be centered over the other two
drives,
but I will also make sure its height matches that of its front panel
bay
hole. After I build all three drive bays, I will cut the floppy drive
bay
hole in the front panel and reposition the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/FrP_CD_Bay_Cutting04.jpg">CD
drive bay hole</a>.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; My three
sheets of
lexan arrived in the mail today. They're not truly lexan, but something
similar called <a href="http://www.portplastics.com/plastics/commodities/HyzodARSHE.html" target="_top">hyzod</a>.
They are the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Top_Panels_Same_Size.jpg">exact
size of my top hatch panels</a> ( 6" x 7"), except they're 1/8" as
opposed
to the hatch panels' 1/16" thickness. After peeling off the protective
coating from either side of one of the panels, I noticed that it was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Lexan_Transparency.jpg">transparent</a>,
almost invisible in fact. It is fairly sturdy for such a lightweight
sheet,
and I'm not disappointed.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; When I get to
  <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>'s
place tomorrow, one of the things I'd like to do is to work on the top
hatch. I have a design in mind; two symmetrical D-shaped windows with
straight
inner edges, and staircase-shaped outer corners. Tonight, I will
perfect
the details of my design on graph paper, and the mark the cut lines on
the sheets by penciling them on to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Top_Construction01_01.jpg">6"
x 7" panels</a>. I'll also have to gather four <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Dresser_Hinges_Open.jpg">hinges</a>
to attach to the hatch's four corners. These hinges are currently part
of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Creamy%27s_Dresser.jpg">broken
dresser</a>, and tonight I will unscrew them, and study them to figure
out how they'll attach to my chassis. During my visit at JD's house, I
will cut out the windows using the cut lines as a guide. Then, I plan
on
bolting two of my three lexan sheets to the underside of the panels,
completing
the windows. After that, I'll work on the dresser hinges. Each hinge
has
some kind of extension that sticks out vertically from the top and
bottom,
and I may have to cut them off before I'll be able to attach the hinges
to my hatch panels. Sometime in the future, I'll need to find or buy a
pair of handles to bolt to the hatch. I'll also need to come up with a
way to fasten the hatch in place so it doesn't open when I don't want
it
to, perhaps with a set of chrome thumb screws or small magnets. To add
a final bit of pizzazz to my top hatch, I plan on using some green EL
cable
to enhance the parameter of my D-shaped windows.</font></font></p>
