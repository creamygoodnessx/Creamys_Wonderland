<font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/14/2003 - I
spent
the whole of yesterday morning taking pictures for my project's photo
log.
I couldn't get rid of the date and time on the upper right corner of
the
screen, and they came out in all of the pics. It took me a while to
realize
this, so I had to retake several of the pics to compensate. The quality
of the photos was surprisingly good, and I didn't fully realize how
good
until I brought <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>
back upstairs to my bedroom and saw the pics through my monitor. The
extreme
blurriness of the TV hindered my progress and hurt my eyes, but
nevertheless,
I got the results I wanted. Because it took two hands to take a picture
(one to hold the camera, the other to use the mouse to click the
capture
button), my parents helped me with three of the pics by providing me
with
an extra pair of hands.</font></font></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; In the
evening, my
dad and my uncle Jimmy convinced me that the washers I planned to use
for
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_01.jpg">reset
button</a> would not solder to the power switch wires. They advised me
to buy some copper washers to replace my current galvanized steel
washers,
or just buy a pre-made button. Not being one to cop out on my front
panel's
crude look, I'm opting to buy the copper washers. Tomorrow, I'll see if
I can go to a plumbing store or a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> after work, and find the washers I need. If I can find
something
to replace my power button's key ring, that would be a pleasant bonus.</font></font>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/13/2003 - I had
a
whole lot of project related things happen yesterday, but I was too
pre-occupied
with my cousin Steven to do this report then. Anyways, shortly after
sunrise,
I finally got my Video In to work on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>.
It turns out that it was a driver issue, and all I did was download the
latest version of <a href="http://www.ati.com/" target="_top">ATI</a>'s
program suite and an updated video driver. Now that I have this issue
resolved,
I can now hook up a video camera to my video card and use it to capture
images on screen.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Jennifer
stopped by
in the afternoon to take me to <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/" target="_top">Best
Buy</a> to replace my defective copy of <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/driving/simpsonshitandrun/index.html" target="_top">The
Simpsons: Hit and Run</a>. She brought over some <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Milk_Caps03.jpg">milk
bottle caps</a> I had collected about 15 years ago, when I intended to
make tokens for some purpose for some unknown reason. Nowadays, I see a
new use for these milk caps. The caps are a variety of colors,
including
green and purple. Besides the fact that these are my two favorite
colors,
they are also the color codes for the mouse and keyboard PS/2 ports. I
plan to cut out a washer-shaped piece of a cap of each color, and glue
them over the PS/2 ports on CES's front panel. I have a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Green_Soda_Cap01.jpg">green
Sprite bottle cap</a>, and I was going to wait until I had a purple
bottle
cap. But four days ago, discovered that my four-inch high front panel
barely
had enough room to accommodate a CD drive, a floppy drive, and a soda
bottle
cap.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; My uncle
Jimmy is
staying over right now, and yesterday evening, he suggested that I
could
get my reset button's small washer to take solder when I eventually
attach
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Custom_Power_Cable02.jpg">power
cable</a> to it. My dad and <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
have been telling me for the past few days that this particular washer
couldn't be soldered, because it's made of some kind of galvanized
steel.
However, Jimmy suggested I could solve this problem by sanding down the
washer where the wire will be soldered.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; As soon as I
finish
this report, I will set my display to 800x600 and shut down, so I can
hook
up Candybox to the TV in the kitchen. I will then hook up my dad's
camera
to my video card, and bring down everything I can get a photo of. I
can't
use the camera to take pictures in my room, because my room is
basically
the only room in the house without a ceiling light, and so there's not
enough light in here to do the job. It's four in the morning, so I
gotta
be quiet so I don't wake up my uncle or his kids.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/9/2003 - While
I
was at work at <a href="http://www.ladyfootlocker.com/" target="_top">Lady
Foot Locker</a> yesterday, I took a close look at how the shelves were
constructed. The vertical L-shaped beams at the sides had
keyhole-shaped
holes all the way down their height. The L-shaped beams that went
across
held up the wooden shelves. They were on the inside edge of the
vertical
beams, and only had holes where they intercepted the vertical beams.
Studying
the shelves gave me a better idea on how to build the aluminum skeleton
of CES. All of the beams are only going to have holes where they
intercept
each other, and there will be holes so the panels can be screwed into
place.
The panel holes on the front vertical beams will be key-shaped,
allowing
the front panel to come off fairly easily. The holes on two of the top
horizontal beams will accommodate the hinges for the top access panel.
The horizontal beams will always rest on the inner edge of the vertical
ones, and will each have a small piece cut out of them so they don't
overlap.
All of the panels will be screwed onto the outer edges of the skeleton.</font></font>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I opened <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
this morning, and found that the floppy/hard drive rack was the exact
size
of my hinged hard drive rack. After some careful consideration, and a
whole
lot of measuring, I've found that my chassis is too small to
practically
support my hinge design. However, I might be able to build a bay that's
held into place only by three or four wingnuts. With this new design,
the
wingnuts can be loosened, the drive rack can be taken out, a new hard
drive
can be screwed into the rack, the rack can be reinserted into the
chassis,
and then the wingnuts can be retightened.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I just made a
major
design change to CES's skeleton. I'm eliminating the three middle
beams.
The aluminum I'm using to build the chassis should be a very strong
material,
and the chassis is only 12" x 12" x 4", so it should be more than
sturdy
enough, even without the middle support. Losing the middle beams should
cut the weight of the chassis from 6.1 pounds to just under 5.4 pounds.
The chassis should also cost almost ten bucks less ($84.30 becomes
$75.80).</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; The
motherboard <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Cable03.jpg">power
switch cable</a> arrived in the mail today. To my great fortune, when I
opened the box, there were not one, but two two-foot long cables. I
tried
to plug one of them into the power pins of Polyfragger's motherboard,
and
it fit just fine. Two days ago, I tried to get my father's video camera
to work with my main rig <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>.
After slaving over my machine for several hours, I couldn't get the
camera
or my VCR to get a picture on my computer. But because today's package
came with two cables, I can proceed to cut one of them in half, and
take
a picture of the other as a "before" pic.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I put one of
the power
switch cables away for safe keeping before preparing the other one for
use as part of my power button. I used a pair of scissors to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Cut_Cable01.jpg">cut
it</a> into two equal <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Cable04.jpg">foot-long
lengths</a>. Using my tiny green <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Swiss_Army_Knife_Emrald.jpg">Swiss
Army Knife</a>, I carefully stripped the end off of one of the halves,
cut the insulating wires with the scissors, and then using the knife
again, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/R&amp;W_Wires02.jpg">stripped
the red and white wires</a>. I then plugged in Polyfragger, replaced
the
power switch cable with <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Custom_Power_Cable02.jpg">my
experimental half cable</a>, and bridged the two exposed wires with
each
of the two washers of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_01.jpg">custom
reset button</a>. The machine came to life, and turned off when I
bridged
the wires with the washer again. In order to test the conductivity of
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button_Parts01.jpg">power
button</a>'s contact points, I wrapped one power switch wire around the
key ring, then touched the copper washer to the key ring and the other
wire. Again, I was able to turn the computer on and off. After my
parents
get back from their four day stay at my brother Peter's house, I'll ask
my dad to solder the wires to my custom switches' contact points. Let's
hope by then Jen either finds her camera, or I can get Candybox's Video
In working so I can plug in a video camera and take a few pictures.</font></font>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/7/2003 - Today,
I
figured it might be best if I only had one 120GB hard drive in my
system,
since this should provide me with more than enough space for my
purposes.
I've never used a <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=241727&amp;Sku=C250-2012&amp;CatId=508" target="_top">PCI
to IDE adapter</a> before, and I don't want to have to deal with
learning
how to use one until I really have to. Besides, hard drives weigh about
one pound each, and having only one will dramatically bring down the
weight
of my computer. However, I will still make two extra hard drive bays in
my computer, so I'll have somewhere to mount the additional drives if I
should ever need any.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I think I've
come
up with a good way to mount the hard drives in my computer. I will
build
a rack of three bays, which will be mounted just behind the front panel
and on the left side of the computer. Normally, the drives will have
their
connectors facing to the right, where the CD and floppy drives are
mounted.
However, the hard drive rack will be fitted with a hinge on its left
side,
which will momentarily allow the hard drives' IDE connectors to face
straight
up, making installation a lot easier.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I've finally
decided
on a name for my custom computer. From this point forward, I will call
it the Creamy Entertainment System, or CES for short. This should make
sense, because of the gaming console feel I'm giving to the computer,
and
because I'm putting my own name on it.</font></font><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/5/2003 - Today,
I
decided to make a quick change in the design of my reset button. I will
flip the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Soap_Pump03.jpg">soap
pump</a> around, so that the button is pushed from the opposite end.
This
was actually my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/Reset_Button02.jpg">original
design</a>, but I didn't think I could keep the washers under the front
panel that way. However, when I put the pen cap on the side with the
washers,
the cap added enough length to the pump for the cap to be above the
front
panel, while the washers could be hidden below. There are two
advantages
to turning the pump around; the reset button will be easier to push,
and
I'll now be able to make use of the pump's built-in cap by using it to
mount the pump inside the case.</font></font> </p>

but
couldn't find the <a href="http://www.cablesonline.net/2pinmpdigaud.html" target="_top">CD
audio cable</a> I was looking for. When I got back home, I called <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
to ask him if he had such a cable. He basically told me that a cable
like
that probably wouldn't fit the motherboard's pins, and even if it did,
it would probably be too flimsy to handle the power needed for a
motherboard
power switch. JD ran a search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22ATX+power+switch%22" target="_top">"ATX

and found some links I could use. There were two sites that sold ATX
power
switches with the cables attached, and another site called TacoNuts
which featured a tutorial on how to build your own power switch. I
found
a <a href="http://www.pccables.com/cgi-bin/orders6.cgi?action=Showitem&amp;id=ID1338342&amp;partno=03203&amp;search=CASE&amp;rsite=pccables.com&amp;rcode=" target="_top">power/reset

that is 24 inches long, and has a 2-pin port on either side, much like
the CD audio cable I was going to use. I bought one of the cables for
two
bucks, but a five dollar <a href="http://www.ups.com/" target="_top">UPS</a>
Ground shipping charge brought the total price to seven bucks. The plan
I have for this cable is the same as the plan I had for the CD audio
cable;
to cut it in half in order to make two 1-foot long cables, strip the

then solder the ends to my power and reset buttons.</font></font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/2/2003 - It
occurred
to me this morning that the VIA
EPIA 800 form factor does not have any floppy drive connectors.
However,
the VIA
EPIA V8000 motherboards do, but at the expense of one of the IDE
ports.
My custom computer will have two hard drives, one floppy drive, and one
laptop DVD burner. Without a floppy connector, I'd have to use one of
my
4 USB ports to hook up a USB floppy drive. I've instead decided to
switch
to the VIA EIPA V8000 form factor and use its floppy connector for a
floppy
drive. I will use the IDE connector for my laptop DVD burner as the
slave
drive, which I will fit with a <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/store/default.asp?c=9#p100" target="_top">CD

I can't use a larger drive than that, since this motherboard only

shopping
online during this morning's earliest hours, I found <a href="http://www.cablesonline.net/2pinmpdigaud.html" target="_top">a
cable that links a CD drive to a soundcard</a>, so that you can play an
audio CD on your computer. The cable is two feet long, and has a 2-pin
connector on either end. I figure I can turn this audio cable into two
useful one foot-long cables; a motherboard power switch cable, and a
motherboard
reset button cable. I can do this by cutting it in half, then stripping
the ends of each half. I could then solder the exposed ends to the
contact
points of my custom made switches. The audio cable goes for $1.50, so
if
it doesn't fit the motherboard's pins, it won't be that much of a loss.</font></font>

out to be the perfect size for the stationary contact point for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/Reset_Button02.jpg">soap
pump reset button</a>. In my parents' bedroom, I took the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Medicine_Bottle03.jpg">empty
prescription bottle</a> I rejected days earlier, and eventually got my
mother's permission to use it. Even though the bottle didn't fit around
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/LipStick_Cap03.jpg">lipstick
cap</a> nearly as well as the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Kite_Spool01.jpg">kite
string spool</a> did, I decided to use it anyway, since its bottom
meant
I wouldn't need a plug. So now, I have no use for the spool, or for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Purple_Screw02.jpg">Austin's
purple toy screw</a>. My plan in building my power switch is now to saw
off the top of the medicine so that it's 30mm high, glue one end of the
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Copper_Spring03.jpg">copper
spring</a> to the lipstick cap, and glue the other end to the inside of
the sawed off medicine bottle. Once I get my hands on a motherboard
power
switch cable, I will strip the sheath off the end of both wires. I will
then solder one wire to the copper washer, and glue the washer to the
top
of the medicine bottle. I'll then solder the other wire to a key ring,
then glue that to the lipstick cap. As for the reset button, I have <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Reset_Button01_Parts.jpg">all
the parts I need</a> to put it together. All I need to do now is buy a
second motherboard power switch cable, strip and solder the wires to
the
washers, then glue all the parts together. Finally, I will test the
button
on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
and hope that the damn thing can actually reset the computer.</font></font></div>
