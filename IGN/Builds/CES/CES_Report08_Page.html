  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">5/11/2004 - During
this
morning's pre-dawn hours, I was once again browsing the Web, but this
time
trying my luck again with finding a PCI riser card which faces towards
the motherboard. After using <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>'s <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;q=" target="_top">Image
Search</a>, I came across a few right facing risers. The one I
currently
have my eye on is a <a href="http://linitx.com/product_info.php?products_id=224&amp;osCsid=d883eb2a04946c8e3a7388c5cb4b659f" target="_top">one
slot riser</a> from <a href="http://linitx.com/" target="_top">LinITX.com</a>.
I can get it for five British pounds, but I'm not yet sure how much
that
will translate to in American dollars. My search for risers began
making
me think about how a typical PCI card would fit into CES with this
riser
in place. So I got one of my 3DFX <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/3DFX_Voodoo_Card.jpg">Voodoo
video cards</a> I keep in storage, and compared it to an online picture
of the <a href="http://www.viaembedded.com/indexN.jsp" target="_top">VIA</a>
Epia <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/viaepiav1000a.html" target="_top">V10000A
motherboard</a> I will order in the future. I found two potential
problems
that may get in the way later on in the project. First, the back end of
a PCI card on a riser in CES will face towards the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>, which means if the card is longer than seven inches, it
won't
fit in the chassis. The other concern is that when a PCI card is lying
horizontally over the motherboard, part of it will hover over the RAM
slots.
However, I can avoid this problem if the riser card is high enough, and
allows the PCI card to hover three inches over the motherboard.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; When I went
to <a href="http://www.memory4less.com/" target="_top">Memory4Less.com</a>
to check the height of the 1GB RAM stick I'm getting, I noticed that
the
price was jacked up to over $300. So it looks like I'll be yet again
searching
for a new RAM stick. Until I find a similar RAM stick for under $250
including
S&amp;H, I will leave that part of the budget unchanged. Also, I'm
going
to leave the riser card off the budget until I can get one that hovers
higher over the motherboard, and won't run into the RAM.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">5/9/2004 - Last
night,
I used a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Digital_Scale.jpg">scale</a>
that my mother bought three days ago to weigh all the parts that I
currently
have of CES. At first, when I tried to weigh the parts on the scale,
nothing
registered. I soon realized that the scale doesn't work if whatever on
it is below a certain weight, perhaps around ten or fifteen pounds. I
was
about to give up on the scale, but just then my parents got back home,
and my mother suggested that I try a differential method of weighing
the
items, where I would first weigh myself, then weigh myself holding the
items, and subtract the difference to get a weight on the items. When I
first tried this method, I was expecting the items to weigh no more
than
eight pounds. I was shocked to learn that CES's parts weighed 10.2
pounds,
a little more than my personal limit of ten pounds. (This weight
included
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Aluminum_Sheet_7x4.jpg">spare
side panel</a>, the spare lexan panel, and the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Maxtor_Drive_Plate.jpg">cover</a>
of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Broken_Hard_Drive01.jpg">my
broken Maxtor</a>.) So then I tried dividing the weight into three
categories;
chassis, drives, and everything else. While weighing the chassis, I put
all the panels of the chassis, except for the spares, into the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Puma_Shoebox.jpg">Puma
shoebox</a>. I included the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">plastic
front panel</a>, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/All_Hinges.jpg">hinges</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Concave_Brass_Knobs.jpg">knobs</a>
for my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Top_Hatch_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch</a>, but also the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/LEDs02.jpg">LEDs</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power&amp;Reset_Buttons.jpg">switches</a>,
because I felt they were too flimsy to go with "everything else". The
result
came out to be around 5.4 pounds, way more that the 3.9 I was
expecting.
For the drives, I put my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Floppy_Drive.jpg">floppy
drive</a> into my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Jasmin_Shoebox.jpg">small
white shoebox</a>, but also included the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Broken_Slimline_CD_Drive.jpg">broken
slimline CD drive</a>, as well as the broken Maxtor with all of its
parts.
This time, the result was around 2.8 pounds. Finally, I weighed
"everything
else", which turned out to be the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hard_Drive_Coolers.jpg">two
fans and one fan mount</a>, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_Packages.jpg">two
grills</a>. Again, I was surprised at the weight, which this time was
about
1.8 pounds. The total weight between the three categories: exactly ten
pounds, the maximum weight limit.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; However, I
don't entirely
trust the scale, nor the results it was giving me. Every time I weighed
something, I first stood on the scale empty-handed to see how much I
weighed
for comparison purposes. The scale gave me readings as low as 124 lbs,
and as high as 128.6 lbs, but 126.4 seemed to be the standard. After I
had weighed the three categories separately and added up the total, I
then
weighed all the items together, and came up with a weight of 9.6 lbs.
After
I had been using the scale for a while, I began to notice that it never
displayed an odd tenth of a pound number, so that all the readings came
out to be .0, .2, 4, etc. Today, I'm going to see if I can get CES's
parts
weighed at the scale in </font></font><a href="http://www.freshobsessed.com/" target="_top"><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"></font></font></a><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.apsupermarket.com/" target="_top">A&amp;P</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">'s
produce section.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I naturally
then started
looking for ways to get CES to lose weight, and in future steps of the
build, there will be plenty of opportunities to do this. Some of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Angle_Irons01.jpg">angle
irons</a> will have bites cut out of them in order to accommodate
certain
other parts of the computer. The biggest example will be the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">seven
inch beams</a> at the top of the chassis, which will each have five
square
inches cut out of them in order to accommodate the top hatch hinges.
Also,
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Back_Panel01.jpg">back</a>
panels will each have a large circular hole cut out of them for CES's
two
fans. Finally, the top aluminum hatch doors still need to have their
windows
holes cut out of them. I'm hoping that this all this chopping down will
give me some relief, but it may not be enough to get CES's final weight
below ten pounds. I weighed everything conservatively, factoring in the
weight of the boxes and individual bags some of the items were in, but
this is only good for shaving off a few ounces at most from the final
result.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Desperate for
more
solutions, I checked my current budget to see if there were any items I
could remove in order to save weight on CES. Out of all the items left
to buy for CES, the 40mm fan and </font><font color="#ffffff"><a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/glowire.html" target="_top">EL
Cable</a></font><font color="#993366"> seemed to be the heaviest. The
slimline
CD drive and hard drive had already been compensated for in the
weighing,
so I didn't consider those for elimination. I eventually decided to
remove
the green EL cable, since it's the one item that I'm least sure of how
to get working right on CES, and it's the one item in which I can't
estimate
its weight, because I've never worked with such a cable before. So
that's
a $9.50 item that's coming off my budget. My computer won't glow as
bright
anymore, but at least now there won't be as much conflicting with the
LED
fan.</font></font> </p>
  <center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ffffff">$725.99 total
budget
- $9.50 for Green EL cable = $716.49 total budget</font></font></p>
  </center>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; While surfing
the
Web for a slimline floppy or hard drive to replace the heavier IDE
version
on my budget, I came across some slimline hard drives on <a href="http://www.directron.com" target="_top">Directron.com</a>,
but none of them sold for less then a dollar a gigabyte, so I
immediately
gave up on that. I found a slimline floppy drive for only twenty
dollars
and was tempted to buy it, but something inside told me to first shop
around
some more. I went to <a href="http://www.newegg.com/" target="_top">NewEgg.com</a>
and ran a search for the word "floppy". The first result was quite a
pleasant
surprise. It was a pair of slimline drives sold as one item, one
floppy,
one CD/DVD drive. The pair sold for only $94.99, and better yet, it
came
with its own rack. I decided immediately to buy the pair, even though
the
CD drive isn't a CD burner, and I'll be paying around thirteen bucks
more
for the pair that for the <a href="http://www.directron.com/snm242.html" target="_top">Samsung
CDRW/DVD drive</a> I was going to get. However, despite these
drawbacks,
switching from the CDRW/DVD drive to the pair of drives will solve two
key problems I'm having with my project. First, switching from my
standard
floppy drive to the slimline floppy drive will significantly reduce
CES's
weight, perhaps by as much as six ounces. This may not seem like much,
but because CES is so close to the weight limit, I can use ALL the
breaks
I can get. Of course, this switch means I won't be using the floppy
with
that <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Square_LED03.jpg">really
cool yellow LED</a>, so it will be a shame to se the work that <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
and I did to change the LED go to waste. The second advantage this
purchase
offers is that it comes with its own drive rack, meaning I may not have
to build one myself! (A major ass itch out of the way, for sure.) I
will
still have to find a way to attach the rack to the inside of the
chassis,
but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. I don't know if I'll still
need to buy a </font><font color="#ffffff"><a href="http://store.yahoo.com/directron/cddvdadapter.html" target="_top">Slimline
CD Desktop to IDE Adapter</a></font><font color="#993366">, so I'll
order
the drive rack first, and take the adapter off of the budget if it
turns
out that I don't need it. But until I can confirm I don't have any use
for it, the adapter stays on the budget.</font></font> </p>

hinges</a> that <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
gave
me for comparison purposes. The first place I visited was a section of
the store where the hinges were sold. I studied the hinges on display,
and using one of JD's hinges <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hinge_Comparison02.jpg">as
a guide</a>, I picked out a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Ives_Middle_Hinges01.jpg">narrower
version</a> of the Ives hinges I bought in Florida. I then went to a
section
where drawer handles were sold. I was looking for a pair of
lightweight,
square, brass knobs. I didn't find any square knobs, but I did find
some <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Concave_Brass_Knobs.jpg">concave
brass knobs</a> which weighed almost nothing, and sold for less than a
dollar a pop. The next place I went to was Returns, where my dad used
his
credit card and filled out the returns slip so I could return the
handles
and hinges I got from Florida. After I bought the new items and the two
of us got home, he returned the eight dollars I had originally given
him
to pay for the old items. If I had remembered, I would have bought 24
bolts
and 24 matching nuts to hold the hinges to my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Top_Hatch_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a>. Oh well, maybe next visit. The pair of hinges cost me
$2.97, while two concave knobs turned out to be $1.96. There was a 30
cent
tax on the total purchase, so I'll split that between the two items.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">5/2/2004 - Just
before
six this morning, I began chopping down my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Front.jpg">piece
of shit Veo Capture 1300</a>. But before I started the disassembly, I
removed
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/32MB_FlashFilm.jpg">32MB
flash memory card</a>, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_CMOS.jpg">CMOS
battery</a>, and and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Rite_Aid_AAs.jpg">four
AA batteries</a> from the camera. When I removed the AAs, I noticed
that
two of them were corroded and / or leaking acid. Since they sure as
hell
weren't like that when I put them into the camera, I assumed that the
camera
somehow caused the leak. This of course made me all the more sure about
disposing of the camera. I began the chop down by using a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Thin_Phillips_Screwdriver.jpg">thin
Phillips head screwdriver</a> to unscrew five screws on various sides
of
the camera, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Frontless.jpg">pulling
off the faceplate</a>. My first concern was the safe removal of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_LCD_Screen.jpg">1"
x 1 1/4" LCD screen</a>, in the hopes that I might someday use it with
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a> of CES. After unscrewing the only screw that was holding it
on,
I noticed that three wires attached it to the camera's main board; a
tiny
white wire, a tiny pink wire, and a thin amber ribbon cable. I was able
to remove the ribbon, but I accidentally broke a plastic piece which
held
it in place. However, I don't think I damaged the wire itself. Sometime
in the future, I'll have to unsolder the pink and white wire from the
main
board, but until then, it will remain stuck to the board. I also
noticed
that the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Small_LEDs.jpg">two
LEDs</a> I was after were encased in some kind of white plastic tubes,
which may prevent me from unsoldering them from the main board, so I'll
have to find a way to remove them without damaging the LEDs.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; When I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Backless.jpg">unscrewed
the mainboard from the backplate</a>, I noticed that there was a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Large_LED.jpg">third
LED</a>, which was red and larger than the other two. It was encased in
the same type of plastic tube as the other two LEDs. After chopping
down
the rest of the camera and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_All_Parts.jpg">laying
all the parts out on the table</a>, I decided what parts to throw away,
and which ones to keep. I salvaged the memory card, CMOS battery, a
clear
tiny plastic plate, LCD monitor, a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Lens_Thingy.jpg">camera-like
object</a>, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Flashbulb.jpg">flashbulb
with its capacitor</a>, and all of the screws. Since I couldn't think
of
a potential use for any of the other parts, I threw them away. I wanted
to keep the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/POS1300_Battery_Casing.jpg">battery
casing</a>, but I was forced to throw it out because it was covered in
battery acid.</font></font> </p>

just now, and found another 1GB RAM stick, this one manufactured by a
company
called Super Talent. At $236.32, this RAM stick may seem more expensive
than the one I was going to get for $223.66, but this time around, I
get
to pay a much more reasonable price for shipping and handling. With the
first stick of RAM, the cheapest S&amp;H charge was $29.95, bringing
the
total up to $253.61. But with the Super Talent RAM stick, the cheapest
shipping charge (Ground Shipping Saver) is only $6.95, bringing the

$179.99
at the time I added it to my budget, so the new RAM stick I'm getting

after I returned
home from <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>,
I was putting away the parts of CES that has been lying around the room
ever since I left for my vacation around two months ago. As I was doing
so, I found <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/JD%27s_Hinges.jpg">the
pair of small piano hinges</a> that <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a>
had given me quite a while back. When I bought the <a href="http://consumer.schlage.com/brands/iveshome.htm" target="_top">Ives</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg">broad
brass hinges</a> in the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1" target="_top">Home
Depot</a> near Aventura, I didn't know I needed two pairs of those
hinges
to fit onto my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Top_Hatch_Panels03.jpg">top
hatch doors</a>. When I got back the condo and realized I needed a
second
pair, I had completely forgotten about the hinges from JD. When I was
putting
away the parts, I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Hinge_Comparison01.jpg">compared</a>
JD's hinges with the Ives hinges, and the three holes on each type of
hinge
matched. The only difference between the two types of hinges, is the
the
Ives hinges are broader and slightly heavier than the ones JD gave me.
The next time I go to the Home Depot here in New Jersey, I'm going to
return
the Ives hinges (the package is still unopened, and I still have the
receipt,),
and see if I can get a pair that more closely matched JD's. If I can't
find such a pair, I will keep the ones I have and use them along with
JD's
hinges. I don't know how much such a pair of hinges will cost, but I
can
still take the second pair of broad hinges I was buy off of my budget.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; A couple days
ago,
I came up with an idea of what to do with my <a href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">piece
of shit Veo Capture 1300</a> that broke itself and will never work
again.
I decided that when I have the time, I will chop the camera down for
any
parts that I can spare. Right now, I have my eyes on the camera's LCD
screen.
It may be an extremely ambitious idea, but if I can salvage that, I may
be able to attach it to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a> of CES, and use it to gauge network activity, the date and
time,
a scoreboard, or anything else my heart desires. I think that something
like this may be out my league, but at least I can take out the CMOS,
the
flash memory card, and the LEDs, and make some use of them in the
future.
My parents already took the strap that was on the camera, but after I
get
my <a href="http://www.comptia.org" target="_top">CompTIA</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certification/a/default.asp" target="_top">A+</a>
studies out of the way, I can have my way with the rest of the camera.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">4/26/2004 - Two
days
ago, while my parents and I were on our way back from <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>,
we stopped by the garage of my aunt Pat and uncle Garret in Virginia.
Because
their family is in the business of car restoration, I explained to my
cousin
Gary how I had used <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Green&amp;Black_Sharpies.jpg">Sharpie
markers</a> to paint the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Side_Panels01.jpg">flames</a>
onto the side panel of CES. I asked him if lacquer was a suitable
protective
coating, and he suggested it was, but I should use a separate piece of
aluminum to test the lacquer on Sharpie ink before applying it to the
real
thing. He warned that the lacquer could cause the Sharpie ink to bubble
and become distorted, so I'll take his advice and test the lacquer on
my
unused side panel. Around 8PM that night, my parents and I arrived at
my
brother Peter's house in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. During our overnight
stay, I asked Peter about using lacquer on my panels. He suggested I
use
polyurethane instead of lacquer as a protective coat, but I forgot why
he made this suggestion. So it looks like I'll be testing both coatings
on my extra panel, and whichever one has the better effect is the one
I'll
use as the coating for my side panels and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a>, once all of the painting is done.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I've been
thinking
a lot about finishing the design on my side panels lately. I already
have
the green flames painted onto the panels, but the top 20 millimeters of
each panel is still unpainted. I've been saving this area for the name
of the project, the Creamy Entertainment System, and for months I was
having
trouble with a final design. Over the past few days, I've come up with
one. The panels are each going to have a different name design. One
panel
will have the words, "THE CREAMY ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM" in 7 x 7 pixel,
1 x 1 centimeter letters in the classic NES font. The words will take
up
three rows, and will be aligned to the left side of the panel, however
I'll have to set aside 20 millimeters on each side of the panel in
order
to accommodate the 4" angle irons. "THE CREAMY" will take up the first
row, and "ENTERTAINMENT" will take up the second. In order to fit the
word
"SYSTEM" on the third row, I'll have to erase the flames on the top two
rows of the existing pattern from the fifth to the tenth column. The
other
panel will have the words, "Jason "Creamy Goodness" Tenn's Creamy
Entertainment
System" in 1/2 x 1 centimeter letters in the Legend of <a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=alttp" target="_top">Zelda:
A Link to the Past</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=fonts" target="_top">font</a>.
The words will be divided into two rows; "Jason "Creamy Goodness"
Tenn's"
will take up the upper row, while "Creamy Entertainment System" will be
on the bottom row. I will not have to erase any of the flames on this
panel
to make room for the letters.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; During this
morning's
pre-dawn hours, I made a slight design change to my <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super Mario Bros.</a>
block
design for my 4" angle irons. Now, only one edge of each beam will be
painted
instead of both, because the front edges will be covered up by the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Front_Panel07.jpg">front
panel</a>, and the back edge of one of the back beams will have a chunk
cut out of it in order to accommodate the rear <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Fan_Test01.jpg">fan</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/CCG_Test01.jpg">grill</a>.
This means that when my sprite aides are finished, I'll have to make 1
x 4 inch grids instead of 2 x 4 on paper to simulate the new design.
I've
already drawn sprite aides for three of the four beams; one with Mario,
one with a Koopa Troopa, and the other with two coins.</font></font> </p>

best to take advantage of my original budget. Instead of buying two
512MB
RAM sticks, I've decided to spend a little more for a single 1GB stick.
Although I'm spending more money now, I'll have an empty DIMM slot that
I can use to get even more RAM on CES if I decide to upgrade in the
future.
After an intensive web search, I eventually came across a 1GB RAM stick
on <a href="http://www.memory4less.com/" target="_top">Memory4Less.com</a>
for a mere $223.66. The cheapest shipping and handling charge I could
find
was Ground Shipping Saver for $29.95, but there's an option to use
either <a href="http://www.fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a>
or <a href="http://www.ups.com/" target="_top">UPS</a> that may be far
cheaper. But I'm not going to update the budget until I know exactly
how
much I'm spending on S&amp;H.</font></font> </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Early this
morning,
I decided to work on the design of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Four_Inch_AI01.jpg">4"
angle irons</a> which will rest vertically on each corner of CES. The
beams
will be decorated with Super
Mario Bros graphics, so that each side of the outside of the beams
will have four 1" squares stacked on top of each other. Each square
will
have a sprite or a block from SMB. In order to copy such graphics, I
visited <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">The
Mushroom Kingdom</a> for some references. I found a picture of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Sprite_Aides/Mario_Blocks/ss_smb_03.gif">Luigi
in an underground area</a>, and the picture contained a Goomba, two
Koopa
Troopas, three types of blocks, and some coins. The picture makes a
perfect
reference for my angle irons, and I plan to draw the graphics in green.
When I zoomed into the image with <a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1184951547051#versionTabview=tab1&amp;tabview=tab0" target="_top">Paint
Shop Pro</a>, I discovered that each block is 16 x 16 pixels in size.</font></font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; Originally, I
was
going to draw all for beams in the same way; a floor brick on the
bottom,
and three breakable bricks on top of those. But now, I think I'll add
some
variety to the design. The floor block will be at the bottom of each
outer
side, but the similarities between the sides will end there. Mario or
Luigi
will be on one of the beams, while another will have a Goomba, while
another
will have a Koopa Troopa. There will also be a variety of patterns of
the
blocks and coins throughout the beams. Before I start applying any
paint
to my aluminum beams, I'm going to make a scale simulation on paper,
just
like I did with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Green_Flame_Sim/Green_Flame_Sim10.jpg">green
flames</a>. Because the blocks are 16 x 16 pixels, I can use my trusty
ruler to make marks 1/16" apart on a sheet of printing paper, and then
draw four 2 x 4 inch grids, each grid representing a beam. Once I come
up with a final design for each of my beams, I will fill in the grids
with
colored pencils. I will then follow a similar procedure with the real
beams,
but I'll have to use fine-point markers to get the job done.</font></font>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">3/29/2004 - This
morning,
I went to the local <a href="http://www.publix.com/" target="_top">Publix</a>
here in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>.
In the produce section, I weighed my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Brass_Handles.jpg">two
brass handles</a>, and my single <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Ives_Broad_Hinges.jpg">pair
of hinges</a>. The total weight was about six ounces, a lot heavier
than
I was hoping for. I'm hoping to keep CES's weight under seven pounds,
and
I'm naturally looking for light weight parts. CES's three drives weigh
about 2.5 lbs, while the case currently weighs about 3.9 lbs., so this
gives me about 0.6 lbs left to work with, or about 10 ounces. I can't
have
4 out of 10 of my remaining ounces be spent just on two handles, so at
the next opportunity I get, I'm returning the brass handles to the <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/HomePageView?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1" target="_top">Home
Depot</a>, and getting a pair of lighter weight handles or knobs. I was
reluctant to give up the handles, because I was going to use their
bolts
to hold my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Top_Hatch_Panels03.jpg">aluminum
top hatches</a> to their <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Chassis_Lexan_Sheets01.jpg">lexan
windows</a>. But now that I think about it, six hinge bolts on the
outer
edge of each door, and one knob bolt on the inner edge may hold the
aluminum
and lexan plates together just fine.</font></font> </p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">3/16/2004 - About
a
week ago, I was eating breakfast in our <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com" target="_top">Aventura</a>
kitchen, when I noticed that our <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Toaster_Oven.jpg">toaster
oven</a> rested on these two long <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log03/Toaster_Oven_CTH.jpg">L-shaped
rails</a>, one on either side. Each rail had a side that acted as the
feet,
and the other part of the L stuck out to the side, acting as a
potential
handle. I'm now hoping I can get my hands on something similar for the
bottom of CES's chassis. The rails would have U-shaped handles,
allowing
me to hold the computer with one hand at my side, just like a
briefcase.
I would prefer the handle be made of plastic in order to cut down on
the
weight, so that I can keep my machine under seven pounds.</font></font></p>
