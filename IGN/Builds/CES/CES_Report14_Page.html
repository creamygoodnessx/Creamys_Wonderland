  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/25/2004 - I
scanned and e-mailed the two sheets of the instructions of how to build
CES to my brother Peter this afternoon. I may even call him tomorrow to
confirm that he got them, and can read them right. As I understand, my
parents are stopping by Peter's house again tomorrow to look at some
more houses. They suggested that if I was too go along again, I could
stay over there until this Saturday when Peter comes back here for
Halloween.<br>
  <br>
&gt; It's been a while since I updated CES's budget, so I guess I can
do that now. The </font></font><font style="color: rgb(153, 51, 102);" face="Book Antiqua">PW-200

  </div>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; This puts me
dangerously close to the end of my budget, and does not leave much
leeway for idot's shipping and handling charge, which I still haven't
determined. To make matters worse, I'm also going to need to order two
new 7" angle irons from </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> to replace the ones </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> and
I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_Errant_Holes.jpg">screwed
up</a> by drilling in the wrong place. Each beam costs $1.40 each,
bringing the total to $2.80. Because I'm only ordering two beams, there
mercifully is no cut fee. I still don't know the shipping and handling
charge for the beams, so that again counts against me.<br>

  </div>
  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; However, I
have been given a big break that pretty much cancels out the extra
expenses I explained above. The <a href="http://www.intel.com/?ppc_cid=ggl%7Ccorporate_intel_corp%7CkC2B%7Cs" target="_top">Intel</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </span>Celeron

$113 to $107.
However, after shopping around a bit, I found a standard Celeron
processor on </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.directron.com/index.html" target="_top">Directron</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> that runs at the same clock speed as the <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/celeron_D/index.htm" target="_top">Celeron
D</a>, but only costs $94.99. I sacrifice half of my Level 2 cache
(128KB
instead of 256KB) from this switch, but this gives me a real shot of
staying within my budget. I never factored in the drop in the Celeron D
processor from $113 to $107, so this switch saves me $18.01.<br>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I may be
paying more for my RAM, but the RAM and the processor were the only two
items I was getting from NewEgg. Now that I'm not getting anything from
NewEgg now, I no longer have to pay their sales tax, which was $8.76.<br>

  <font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/24/2004 - I
visited my brother Peter's house in south Jersey today in order to work
on building CES's chassis. My parents and I spent about an hour
checking out a new house we are considering buying, and when I got back
to Peter's place, I planned on using <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Drill_Press.jpg">Peter's
drill press</a>. Peter stayed
with my parents for another hour and a half at the new house before
coming back to his place, which was when I asked him to show me how to
use the press. He said it was too late in the day to work on the
chassis, but he did offer to drill the holes for me if I showed him how
I wanted it done. I did my best to explain to him how I wanted CES to
be put together, but he suggested that I draw out the details and then
fax them to him. So when I came back home, I drew out some detailed
blueprints of the chassis construction on two sheets of printing paper.
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Assembly01.jpg">One
sheet</a> explains the which 4" angle irons are to be attached to
which </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels06.jpg">side
panels</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">,
and how to apply the bolts to the </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Four_Inch_AI04.jpg">4"
beams</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">.
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Scans/Sketches/CES_Assembly02.jpg">The
other sheet</a> lists a detailed set of instructions of how to build
the
chassis step by step. I'm not so good with fax machines, so I will scan
and e-mail the blueprints to Peter when I get the chance. I feel a bit
uneasy about leaving the parts of CES at Peter's, and leaving my
project's fate in the hands of someone other than myself. But Peter's
been building things long before I have, and I hope that he can follow
my blueprints accurately.<br>

  <font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/20/2004 - When I
was writing yesterday's log, I forgot to mention that I tested <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button04.jpg">the
switch</a> after I finished strengthening it. I brought the switch
upstairs
to my sister's old bedroom. I looked for my old <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Pepsi_Bottle_Top02.jpg">Pepsi
bottle top</a>, but
couldn't find it. During previous tests of my power switch, I used this
bottle top to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Power_Button03.jpg">stabilize
the button</a>, and prevent the lipstick cap from
swaying too much as I pushed it. Deciding to proceed with the test
without the bottle top, I dragged <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Polyfragger.jpg">Polyfragger</a>
out of the closet and
plugged it in. After I plugged in my custom power switch to the
appropriate motherboard pins, I touched both contact points to a metal
surface inside the case to test the lower half of the switch's cable.
The computer didn't turn on, so I pushed the jumper connector all the
way down over the pins and tried again. The computer came to life, and
so I touched the screws to the metal surface again to turn it off. I
then pushed the button, and once again, Polyfragger turned on. I
pushed the button a few more times, and the computer turned on and off
as I hoped it would. With the testing a success, I plugged out the
switch and put it away. <br>

  <font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/19/2004 - It's
been ten days since I last planned on drilling the bolt holes in CES's
chassis, and I STILL haven't gotten to it. I got very little sleep and
was too tired to go to Peter's house, and </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> was having his mother over
so I couldn't spend time at his place either. The following weekend, JD
and Jen were holding a birthday party for my nephew Brandon who will
turn two in a few days, and although I stopped by their place for the
party, there wasn't time to do any drilling. So this coming weekend, I
hope to finally drill the holes in my angle
irons and </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">panels</font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">, and
finally see this thing in one piece.<br>
  <br>
&gt; Yesterday, I asked JD if I could borrow his <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Soldering_Iron.jpg">soldering
iron</a> for a
while. He gave the iron and some solder to my parents who were visiting
JD to see my nephews. I was too tired to do any soldering that day, but
I did manage to get to it today. My goal was to strengthen the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Power_Button01.jpg">power
button</a> by replacing its flimsy wire with something stronger. About
a
month ago, I found an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AV_Cable.jpg">audio/video
cable</a> that appeared thicker than the
wire I planned to replace. I began the task of strengthening the power
button by <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AV_Cable_Halves.jpg">cutting
the AV cable in half</a> with a pair of scissors, and
then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AV_Cable_Decapitated02.jpg">cutting
the AV connectors off</a> of one of the halves. On that same
half of cable, I stripped the sheaths off of one of the ends, and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AV_Cable_Stripped.jpg">cut
away the shielding</a>. This exposed two thinner sheathed wires, one
red and one grey. I then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AV_Cable_Unsheathed01.jpg">stripped
off the sheathing</a> of the two wires,
exposing the wire, which was only slightly thicker than the cable I was
replacing. I repeated the process on the other end of the cable, so
that the cable had a total of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AV_Cable_Unsheathed02.jpg">four
exposed wires</a>; two on each end.<br>
  <br>
&gt; My next task was to prepare the two brass screws, which were the
contact points for the power button, for tinning. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Custom_Power_Cable_Removed.jpg">separated
the wire</a>
from the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button_Unwired.jpg">power
switch</a> by removing the black electrical tape from the
screws, and I was surprised at how sticky and dirty they were. So I
cleaned them off with a dry paper towel and a tiny bit of soap. I then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Custom_Power_Cable_Decapitated.jpg">cut
the jumper connector</a> off of the cable just below the heat shrink,
and then carefully <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Jumper_Unsheathed.jpg">stripped
off the red and white sheaths</a>. Now, I was
ready to tin all of the surfaces for soldering. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/PwB_Screws_Removed.jpg">removed
the two brass
screws</a> from the power switch, because I was afraid the tinning
process
would melt the thin plastic medicine bottle which was the body of the
switch. The soldering process was a bit tricky to get used to, but soon
I got the hang of it. The solder kept clumping up on the screws, so I
turned the wattage up on the iron from 15 watts to 30. Once I did that,
the solder melted like butter. I made sure to not get any solder on the
front of the bolts, because if I did, I wouldn't be able to screw the
bolts back into the switch's holes. Once the bolts were <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Brass_Screws_Tinned.jpg">tinned</a>,
I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button_Tinned.jpg">put
them back into place</a>.<br>
  <br>
&gt; Using the setting of 15 watts on the soldering iron, I tinned the
four exposed wires of the cable, and then the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Jumper_Tinned.jpg">two
exposed wires</a> of the
jumper connector. I then twisted the white wire of the jumper with the
grey wire on one end of the cable, and then the red wire on the same
end of the cable to the red wire of the jumper block. I decided to
solder the cable to the switch next, since this was the more difficult
end of the cable to solder, and I wanted to get it over with first. I
peeled the two wires of the cable apart a little further, and then
wrapped the exposed wires around the brass screws. Not too much of the
wires were exposed, so they didn't wrap around the screws as much or as
well as I would have liked them to. I couldn't get the tinned surfaces
to solder together, so I was forced to use additional solder. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Power_Button_Soldered.jpg">completed
the soldering</a>, but I accidentally loosened the screws from
their mounts. In order to get them to fit more solidly, I used the
soldering iron to melt a gluestick, and glued around the outside of the
switch where the bolts were. The result was a tighter fit, but not as
tight as they were before. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Jumper_Soldered.jpg">soldered
the other end of the cable</a> to the
jumper connector to finish the strengthening of the switch. Finally, I
wrapped electrical tape <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Jumper_Resheathed.jpg">around
the exposed wires</a> of the jumper
connector in order to prevent any accidental short circuiting. <br>

  <font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/9/2004 - It's
almost six in the morning, and I'm going over to my brother Peter's
later on today to use his <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Peter%27s_Drill_Press.jpg">drill
press</a>. I spent a few hours this morning
going over how I'm going to assemble CES's chassis. To cut a long story
short, I found that the holes drilled in two of my four 7" angles were
in the wrong place. If I were to drill holes in my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Four_Inch_AI04.jpg">4"
beams</a> to
accommodate the holes already in the 7" beams, the 4" angle holes would
be way off to one side, and the bolts would look awkward against the
painted background. When I painted my 4" beams, I made sure the
patterns would go with the bolts, so that the position of the bolts
went with the images. On some of the 4" beams are used "?" blocks or 3D
blocks on the top or bottom of the beam. The bolts are supposed to go
in the center of these blocks, making them look like they're part of
the image. Because the bolt holes in the two 7" beams are out of place,
they are now useless to me as parts of CES. This means I'll have to
order two replacement 7" beams from </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">. When I checked
the site, I found that I could get two more of such beams for a total
of $2.80, which I can barely afford since my project's budget is
bottoming out. If the shipping and handling costs too much, I'll have
to cut back on components that I have yet to order, and this could mean
getting a less powerful <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/celeron/index.htm" target="_top">Celeron</a> processor.<br>
  <br>
&gt; It looks pretty obvious now that I'll have to rethink how I'm
going to assemble my chassis. Instead of putting together the bottom
assembly first, and then the side assemblies, and then bolting the
three parts together, I have decided to base all of the chassis'
construction on the four inch angle irons. This is because the exact
positions of the bolts on the 4" beams matter more than on any other
beams. In order to see if this was a good way of assembling the
chassis, I simulated the construction bit by bit by <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Chassis_Construction03_-_Tape.jpg">holding
the beams
together with Scotch tape</a>. I found from the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Chassis_Construction03_04.jpg">simulation</a>
that some of the
beams have a slight curve to them and are not true right angles.<br>
  <br>
&gt; Here's how CES's chassis will now be put together. I will start by
drilling the holes in my 4" angle irons, since I know exactly where
those holes need to go; in the middle of the top and bottom square inch
blocks of each beam. I will fit a 7" beam into a 4" beam, pushing the
7" beam as far into the curved inner edge of the 4" beam as I can while
avoiding the curve and keeping the two beams firmly pressed against
each other. I would then use the hole in the 4" beam to mark the drill
hole in the 7" beam, drill through the mark and then bolt the two beams
together. Then, I will take the corresponding 4" beam, and attach it
to the other side of the 7" beam in the same manner. I would then
repeat with the bottom 7" beam and two 4" beams on the other side of
CES. When the left and right sides of CES are bolted together, I will
put the 12" beams on top of the 7" beams, one in front and one in back,
and they will bridge the two sides of CES together. I will make sure to
bring the edges of the 12" beams to the curved inner edges of the 7"
beams, but just enough to keep the 12" beams resting firmly within the
7" beams. I will then mark the drill holes on either side of the 12"
beams, drill the holes, use those holes to mark the drill holes in the
7" beams, and again drill accordingly. Once the drill holes of the
skeleton are in place, I will shave a bit of the 12" long edge off of
the </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">
to make it fit in the bottom of the skeleton, mark the
drill holes on the panel, drill the holes, and then bolt the panel into
place. Finally, I will put the </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels06.jpg">side
panels</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">
in their place between the
4" and 7" beams, mark and drill the holes, and then bolt the side
panels into place. It's just after 7PM and I've got to pack all this
stuff up so I can get some sleep, however little I manage to get.<br>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">9/27/2004 - I
have less than $18 in my budget, and last night I went to <a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/" target="_top">OnlineMetals.com</a>
and determined that replacing my rounded-cornered 7"
and 12" angle irons with <a href="http://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?id=63&amp;step=2" target="_top">flat-cornered versions</a> would cost me over
twenty bucks, meaning I'd most likely have to downgrade one of my
components to afford it. So naturally, that's something I want to
avoid. Just before midnight, I took another look at my angle irons and </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels06.jpg">side
panels</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">,
hoping that I could at least salvage something. While
studying the chassis parts for nearly two hours, I realized that the
chassis was not in as bad a condition as </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> and I first believed. There
were three basic problems that prevented me from building my chassis
with my current plans. First, there will be two bolt holes on either
side of each angle iron, and the holes are oriented so that the two
bolts will be at right angles of each other. The two bolts appear to
run right into each other, and at first, I thought this was going to be
a problem. However, the bolts only run into each other when they're <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Bolt_Collision01.jpg">going
through the angle iron alone</a>. When the chassis is completed, most
of the bolts will in fact go through an angle iron, a panel, and then
another angle iron. This will greatly reduce how much the end of each
bolt is exposed, and leave just enough room for a nut to be fastened
onto it. The bolts will not run into each other, so the first problem
becomes a non-issue.<br>
  <br>
&gt; The second problem is a possible wobbling of the chassis parts
after the bolts are in place. The bolts may not hold tightly enough to
keep the chassis from wobbling. But I know from my experience in
building the </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">
that bolts can hold two parts just fine, but I
forgot to tell JD that. I tested a pair of nuts and bolts on two of the
7" beams which had the bolt holes drilled into them, but couldn't get a
real solid fit; the beams kept wobbling. But if I had some kind of tool
to use to tighten the bolts instead of using my hands, I think the
bolts would have held much tighter.<br>
  <br>
&gt; The third problem is that the angle irons have rounded corners,
and this may interfere with fitting them together. However, I've
noticed that the 12" beam, which is riveted to the 7" beam, does not go
all the way into the 7" beam, but stops at the 7" beam's rounded
corner. If all the angle irons are riveted together in this fashion,
the rounded corners won't matter. This will mean that I won't have to
order the flat-cornered beams, and won't have to downgrade any of my
components.<br>
  <br>
&gt; I'm going to address these issues the next time I talk to JD. If
he agrees that the angle irons are still salvageable as is, I plan to
try building the chassis again this coming weekend. After popping out
the rivet in the 12" and 7" beam, I plan on drilling the rest of the
holes in the chassis, and then bolting everything together. The </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">
is too wide to fit into the bottom assembly as it is, so we might
have to saw off some of the edge. But I'm not getting my hopes up just
yet; there's still plenty of ways I can screw up the chassis.<br>
  </font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">9/26/2004 - Just
before midnight last night, I applied a fourth and final coat of nail
polish to the 4" angle irons. The polish made the beams shinier with
every coat. This morning, I started preparing the angle irons and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels05.jpg">side
panels</a> for the four coats of </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Minwax_Polycrylic.jpg">Polycrylic</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">. I went to the garage to
look
for a block of wood I could use to keep the painted surfaces of the
angle irons level, but couldn't find one of an appropriate size. It
soon dawned on me that I could use the box of <a href="https://www.dunkindonuts.com/" target="_top">Dunkin Donuts</a> I
got
yesterday while going out for pizza as a support. So after taking the
remaining donuts out the box and onto a glass dish, I removed the angle
irons from the edge of the table, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_On_Donut_Box01.jpg">taped
them onto each corner of
the donut box</a>, using the same pieces of tape that held them to the
table. At around 12:30 this afternoon, I took the box, the side panels,
and the Polycrylic outside, but not to the backyard as usual. Instead,
I brought them to the front of the house, on the walkway to our front
door. I laid the side panels on the stone walkway <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI&amp;SP_On_Walkway.jpg">close
to the donut
box</a>, took a deep breath, and then sprayed the first thin coat of
Polycrylic on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/SP_Polycrylic01.jpg">panels</a>
and the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_On_Donut_Box02.jpg">angle
irons</a>. Today, I'm going to allow
40 minutes for each coat to dry instead of an hour; Jen or </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a></font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"> will pick
me up later this afternoon, and I want to make sure that all coats are
done by then. It's already been over 40 minutes since that first coat,
so I better get right to the
second coat.<br>
  <br>
&gt; About 15 minutes after I put the second coat of Polycrylic on my
angles and panels, Jen called me to tell me she was picking me up in
about an hour. I asked for an additional half hour to let the
Polycrylic dry, and she said fine. I have since applied the third coat
on the angles and panels, and in a few minutes I will apply the fourth
and final coat. I just hope that last coat is dry enough for transport
by the time Jen or JD come to pick me up.<br>
  <br>
&gt; It's just before 10PM, and I just got back from JD's house. Things
didn't exactly go as planned, and my memory isn't really that good, but
I'll describe what happened the best I can. I showed JD what I had in
mind for the bottom assembly of CES, which consisted of two <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">7"
angle
irons</a> on the sides, two <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Twelve_Inch_AI.jpg">12"</a>
on the opposite sides, and the 12" x 7" <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Bottom_Panel01.jpg">bottom
panel</a>. After carefully determining where on the 7" we wanted the
bolt holes to go, JD drilled two holes on either side of the 7" angles.
He used his drill press to drill the holes, and the machine cut through
the aluminum like warm butter. It was also much more accurate than the
holes I drilled while putting together my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/Top_Hatch_Doors03.jpg">top
hatch</a>. When JD had <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Drilling_Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">drilled</a>
all eight holes in the two 7" beams, and one hole in one of the
12" beams, he noticed a major problem. The vertically oriented bolts
that will hold together the bottom assembly, and the horizontally
oriented bolts which will hold the 7" beams to the 4" beams will run
into each other. JD attempted to solve this problem by riveting the
bottom sections together, but after he put the first bolt in, he
noticed some other problems. For one thing, my angle irons have rounded
inner corners, and while these give them a little extra strength, they
make fitting the angles together very difficult. JD was also worried
that the bolts may not hold the bottom panel tightly to the bottom
angle irons. So we stopped construction for the day, and JD suggested
that I order some flat-cornered angle irons.<br>

arrived at the house today just before 1PM, and lent me her <a href="http://users.skynet.be/inforad/coolpix_macropfhoto.htm" target="_top">CoolPix digital camera</a>. After taking three pictures

the smell was gone. So I did the scratch test on it with my fingernail
and a sharp edge of the left test panel. The scratching went all the
way through to the aluminum, so I'll consider that a failure. It looks
like I'll be using two coats of </font></font><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail

four inch beams</a> and side panels.<br>
  <br>
&gt; I decided it was time to apply the nail polish to the angle irons,
and I began with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI_-_Fire_Flower23.jpg">Fire
Flower beam</a>, since I considered that to be the most expendable of
the four. I taped the beam to the edge of the table, and applied a
single coat to the beam, from <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_FF_Coating01.jpg">bottom</a>
to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_FF_Coating03.jpg">top</a>,
one line at a time. There was so sign of smudging or any distortion, so
I'll consider that a success to far. I then filled in more of the top
of the right panel's empty spaces with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log04/PM05_Black.jpg">black
Pigma Micron</a>. I used my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy%27s_Ruler02.jpg">aluminum
ruler</a> to measure half an inch from the right edge of the panel, and
  <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Right_Panel_Filler01.jpg">marked
it with the Micron</a>. Then I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Right_Panel_Filler02.jpg">filled
in the space</a> in the top right corner of the panel between the mark
and the right edge of the letters. I then followed suit with the left
edge, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Right_Panel_Filler03.jpg">marking
half an inch in</a> and then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Right_Panel_Filler04.jpg">filling
in the empty space</a>. The idea was that after the 4" beams cover the
sides of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Right_Panel06.jpg">the
panel</a>, all exposed areas of the panel will be non-blank.<br>
  <br>
&gt; It's just after 5PM, and I have applied the first coat of nail
polish to all four angle irons. However, I did have a little problem
with the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI_-_Mario42.jpg">Mario
beam</a>. I started from the top and worked my way down. When I got to
the 3D block, I noticed that the tip of the nail polish brush had <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Green_On_NP_Brush.jpg">a
bit of light green</a> on it. It turns out that the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Light_Green_Sharpie.jpg">light
green Sharpie</a> ink doesn't like the nail polish, and melts when it
comes in contact with it. So now, the top and left sides of the block
are now <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_Mario_Coating02.jpg">badly
smudged</a>, but the block still looks like a 3D block, and so I'll
leave it as it is. When I got to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/AI_-_Coins16.jpg">Coins
beam</a>, I began by applying the polish <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_Coins_Coating01.jpg">around
the outer parimeter of the light green part</a> of the 3D block, and
then <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/AI_-_Coins_Coating02.jpg">covering
the rest of the beam</a>, leaving the light green uncovered. Because I
now know the nail polish melts the light green Sharpie ink, I've
decided to protect the side panels with the Polycrylic alone. Speaking
of the side panels, I applied <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Left_Panel_Filler.jpg">a
tiny bit more black Micron ink</a> to the sides of the top letter area
of the left panel, in order to make sure everything that's not covered
by the side 4" beams will be covered with ink.<br>
  <br>
&gt; Just after 6PM, I finished applying the second coat of nail polish
to my angle irons before going out for some pizza. Once again, I did my
best to avoid the light green areas of the 3D blocks. After 9PM, I
noticed that the top part of the Koopa Troopa beam still felt like
aluminum, so I put on a third coat on the beams. I may even put on a
forth coat for good measure, but I still haven't decided if I'm going
to do that yet. It's too late to put on the four thin coats of
Polycrylic on the beams and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels05.jpg">panels</a>
tonight, but I plan to apply the
first coat tomorrow at 10AM, and then add an additional coat every
hour. With the extra coat of nail polish, I may not need a super-thick
coat of Polycrylic on the beams.<br>

one a black smiley filled with yellow, and an orange and black four
square checker pattern. I then put two coats of Power Shield nail
polish on each pattern. In less than half an hour, I will bring the
panel outside to spray a single super-thick coat of Polycrylic on it,
and after it dries, I'll give the test patterns another scrape test.<br>
  <br>
&gt;&nbsp; My parents took their <a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">digital camera</a> with them to Florida for a week, so I
tried bringing <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>
downstairs to hook it up with a video camera, just like I did back in
December. However, it was more trouble than it was worth; the shots I
got turned out too bright, the blurry image on the TV was giving me a
headache, and the <a href="http://www.digitalriver.com/v2.0-img/operations/ati/ATI_1c.html" target="_top">ATI</a> Video In program kept crashing. So I thought to
myself, "fuck it", and put back the camera and Candybox, then I called
Jen and asked to borrow her <a href="http://users.skynet.be/inforad/coolpix_macropfhoto.htm" target="_top">digital camera</a>. She said she may get here this
evening or tomorrow, and I have to finish testing before sundown, so I
won't be able to take pictures of the test panel as I work on it. I'm
planning on going over to her place tomorrow afternoon so <a href="http://www.jdluke.com/" target="_top">JD</a> can help me bolt
the chassis together, but I'll need to put the protective nail polish /
Polycrylic cocktail on the 4" beams and the side panels first. But
before I can do even that, I'll have to wait until I'm finished testing
the finishing coats on my test panels.<br>
  <br>
&gt; About an hour after I sprayed the thick coat on my right top hatch
cutout, I brought it inside. I knew it wouldn't be dry yet, but it was
almost 7PM, and the sun was going down. The panel still feels a little
sticky and soft, and it still has a slight chemical smell to it, but I
didn't notice any spotting. I'm going to continue checking the panel,
smelling it on occasion, and once the smell is gone and the Polycrylic
hardens, I'm going to do a scratch test on it. If it passes, two coats
of nail polish and one super-thick coat of Polycrylic will be the
choice protection for the real thing.<br>
  <br>
&gt; I also <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/CES_-_All_Parts%288-20-2004%29.jpg">laid
out all of CES's current parts</a> on the kitchen table in preparation
for the next CES_All_Parts picture. It's well after 9PM, and it doesn't
look like Jen will show up tonight with the camera. So I guess I'll
have to leave all the parts there until she shows up tomorrow. As soon
as I take the shots, I'm going to fill in some of the blank portions of
the side panels, and after they dry, I will apply the protective coat.<br>

  <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">9/23/2004 - Less
than an hour ago, I took a closer look at the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/LHC_Polycrylic_Dry03.jpg">left
top hatch cutout</a> I sprayed yesterday. Although I could scratch off
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Minwax_Polycrylic.jpg">Polycrylic</a>
with my fingernail, it still protected better than the acrylic.
However, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/LHC_Smiley_With_Polish.jpg">smiley
face</a> on the panel still had the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Sally_Hansen_Power_Shield.jpg">nail
polish</a> covering it, and I had sprayed the four thin coats of
Polycrylic on top of that. When I scratched at the smiley with my
thumbnail, I couldn't scratch it off. I began to think that I was on to
something, so I did some further testing. I took a paper towel and
after fogging the smiley with my breath, I rubbed it with the paper
towel. The smiley remained in tact, but I still had one final test in
mind. I brought down my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Seven_Inch_AI.jpg">seven
inch angle irons</a> from my room to the kitchen, and rubbed the sharp
corner of one of the beams on the smiley. Only a small piece of the
smiley came off, proving that a nail polish / Polycrylic combo could
protect my panels better than anything I had tried before. But before I
actually use the cocktail on my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log05/Four_Inch_AI03.jpg">4"
beams</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log06/Side_Panels04.jpg">side
panels</a>, I'm going to spray a thick coat of Polycrylic on the left
test panel, and experiment with 2 coats of nail polish plus one thick
coat of Polycrylic on the right test panel.<br>
