Hey, I'm Jason "Creamy Goodness" Tenn, formerly known as Jatoten Rascot.
Welcome to my humble digital abode, Creamy's Wonderland, formerly known
as the Infinite World of Wonder. This site is where I display both my 2D
and 3D art, as well as my developing fantasy story, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>. This site is always being updated, but I try to work on it at
a comfortable pace. Enjoy your stay.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080"><font size=+1>NEWS</font></font></font></center>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font size=+1><font color="#99FF99">5/8/2003 -</font><font color="#33FF33">
Just a couple of minor updates this time. I've overhauled <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Creamy_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Creamy
Goodness'</a> Gwahrai Sling. It originally had 285 patches, but I managed
to cut it down to 112. Also, I've added Chapter 2 to my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">research
notes</a> for <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">Of
Pandas an</a></font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">d
People</a></font><font color="#33FF33">. And, not 15 minutes ago, I realized
that I got the year wrong on my front page updates, so that this year's
updates were shown as 2002, but that's now been fixed. No wonder the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
people thought my site was abandoned. :)</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>4/28/2003 -
Creamy's Wonderland has been having a bit of down time lately, because
the folks at <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
apparently thought I wasn't updating my site and let it sit too long. But
thanks to the efforts of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/r13" target="_top">rogue13</a>
and bearkub of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/" target="_top">Polycount</a>,
Creamy's Wonderland is back and in full effect, and I have several site
updates in store for you. For the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section of CW, I've fixed the left frame menu, so that all the
LFM pages of EB showed the Races and Research Notes icons. I've given the
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Gwahrai</a>
page under <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Races_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Races</a>
a bit of polishing up. I'm also studying a new book for my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Research
Notes</a> section, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/RN-Pandas(fs).html" target="_top">Of
Pandas and People</a>. During the past few days, I also found some time
to do some quick sketches of my latest Evil Blood character <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Jonny-V(fs).html" target="_top">Jonny-V</a>.
As for the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake
2</a> section, the second section of my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Q2
modeling tutorial</a>, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Animations</a>,
is now up. I haven't come up with a lot of the screenshots yet, but I plan
to get that done as I work on <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tony_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Tony
Toponi</a>.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>4/6/2003 - I'm
pleased to announce that there are two new pages in CW's <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. The long awaited <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Races_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Races</a>
page is finally here, but so far, only the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Gwahrai</a>
page is up. I didn't have time to write down everything I wanted on that
page, but I'll definitely fix it in a future update.&nbsp; The other new
page is <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Research_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Research
Notes</a>, a page where I'm now archiving everything I've researched that
may apply to Evil Blood, and may help me make it a better story. Also,
I've been working a little on my two <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2
</a><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/PPM_Page(fs).html" target="_top">PPM</a>
works in progress, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
and <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Creamy_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Creamy
Goodness</a>.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>3/20/2003 -
And now, for the site's first update in nearly five months. There are two
new works in progress on the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/PPM_Page(fs).html" target="_top">PPMs</a>
page in the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
section. <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Creamy_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Creamy
Goodness</a> is the new name of my Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage model, and
is finally on its way to becoming a Quake2 PPM. And as promised, the guy
you voted for in the Kissing the Public's Ass poll, <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
is also in the works. Also, there is a new character profile up on the
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Characters_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Character</a>
page, so say hi to <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Jonny-V(fs).html" target="_top">Jonny-V</a>.
The spoiler on <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Binky(fs).html" target="_top">Binky's</a>
page has been updated, but you may not care to see it if you have the extreme
patience to wait until I release the Evil Blood comic, if I ever get to
releasing it.&nbsp; Finally, I made a few minor fixes throughout the site,
mainly correcting spelling errors.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/26/2002 -
On this update of Creamy's Wonderland, I overhauled the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake
2</a> section's <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Archive_Page(fs).html" target="_top">news
archive</a>. I basically moved the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Follycount_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Follycount</a>
news archive up one directory level, gave it a more appropriate name, and
added some old news items from the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/PPM_Page(fs).html" target="_top">PPMs</a>
page.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/22/2002 -
I finished the updates to <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Stardancer(fs).html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
profile and spoiler that I started two days ago. Also, I've changed the
way that the old news is organized in the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> and <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Quake2_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Quake
2</a> sections of Creamy's Wonderland. I started on this change by moving
the news on Stardancer's page over to the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/Characters_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Characters</a>
main page, and removing the old news from Stardancer's spoiler page.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/20/2002 -
A few more updates, if you care. First and most obviously, I've picked
out a new wallpaper for CW's front page. It's one that was on this page
years ago, but I liked it enough to give it a second term, if you will.
The page titles have also been fixed, and it's a hell of a lot better than
seeing 'Welcome to Abode GoLive 5' everywhere you go. I just recently figured
out how to link this site's files to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/" target="_top">FilePlanet</a>
as opposed to my private site directories, thanks in no small part to <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/r13" target="_top">rogue13</a>,
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/socialnemesis/" target="_top">SocialNemmesis</a>,
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/gauss/" target="_top">gauss</a>,
and everyone else at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/" target="_top">Polycount</a>
who took the time to help me out. Finally, I've partially updated <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Stardancer(fs).html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
story. I didn't have time to get all the updates on her page finished,
but I'll definitely rectify that on a future update.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/10/2002 -
A couple more minor cosmetic updates, as well as a long overdue page. As
you might have noticed, I've fixed the transparency problem that gave the
candles a solid white background. The front page icon in the left frame
menu as been replaced by something a little more pleasing to the eye. Finally,
the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/art_gallery/art_fans(fs).html" target="_top">Fan
Art</a> section is now available for your viewing pleasure.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/8/2002 -
Just a couple of quick fixes to the incomplete update six days ago. Yesterday,
I uploaded a completed version of the new mural, and today, I finished
its frame. I managed to get the frame to accommodate the counter as well,
and that turned out to be a nice convenience. The sides of the frame are
not supposed to be white like that; <a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/alchemy.html" target="_top">GIF
Construction Set</a> somehow sucked the transparency right out of them
while I was animating them, but I'll have them fixed in a future update.
Also, I've completed a few link fixes throughout the site. (Icon fixes
on <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/ITF_Intro(fs).html" target="_top">Evil
Blood's</a> main page and <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&Bones_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Mesh
and Bones</a>, and an updated <a href="http://www.divx.com/" target="_top">DivX</a>
link to be exact.)</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size=+1>10/2/2002 -
Welcome to the new and improved Infinite World of Wonder, or should I say
Creamy's Wonderland? That's right, this site has been completely re-done,
and is now easier to navigate through, and simply just looks better. I
didn't have time to make all the updates I was hoping to make, but I did
get to squeeze in a couple of them. The story for <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Binky(fs).html" target="_top">Binky</a>
has been re-written, and there are a few more draft pics of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/ITF/bio-Oinkillune(fs).html" target="_top">Oinkillune</a>
on his page. I've also halted construction on <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">BJQ2T</a>
indefinitely, but will continue to develop the rest of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Follycount_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Follycount</a>
behind the scenes. However, I didn't have enough time to finish the new
mural, so I had to settle for an unfinished version. On a future update,
I'll make the mural more presentable, and I'll even come up with a snazzy
looking frame for it as well. That's all for now, Rascot out.</font></font></font>
