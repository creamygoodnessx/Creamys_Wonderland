<p><font color="#ff8080">3/29/2K - All righty then.
Its been a while
since
my last update. I've been spending this time creating a new Quake2 PPM,
one which I first modelled for a contest at Polycount. The model is
finished,
and now makes its home on Quake2 / PPMs. Speaking of the PPMs page, the
Future Models section has been removed, because I'm going to be bogged
down with the mind numbing work I have to do in order to get the first
few chapters of Into the Fray: Hour of Need finished by the end of the
year. You can find out more about the progress I make on this daunting
project as I get it done by checking out the soon to be opened Into the
Fray / Internet Show page. Getting this project done is sure to be a
bitch,
but then again, so is life.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">2/11/2K - Check out the
all-new House of
Cantar
page in the Into the Fray / Tour Guide section of IWOW. All right, I
know
it's been ages since I updated the Quake2 section, but here goes. I
have
just entered the modelling contest of my life. Visit the Quake2 / PPMs
section for further details on this exciting event.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">1/31/2K - Information about
the etmayoos is
now
available in Into the Fray / Races. I also made several fixes
throughout
the entire Into the Fray section of IWOW, including fixing a few
spelling
errors, and adding new stats to the Into the Fray / Characters section.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">1/12/2K - The bios for
Thunderbird and
Cardiano
are up and running in the Into the Fray / Characters page.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">12/30/99 - The Characters
page is now open,
and
it features the profiles of Jatoten Rascot and Brandy Hothiegh.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">12/25/99 - Merry Christmas,
visitors! The
races
page is up and running, and it already comes with two races,
quinnisalzes
and ambrons. Also, the Chiddetny Page under Into the Fray / Tour Guide
has been updated.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">12/20/99 - The Chiddetny
Gargantuan page is
only
partially completed but up and running anyway. This page is located
under
Into the Fray / Tour Guide / Chiddetny. I finally decided to change the
name of Destination: Blarr. It was supposed to be a temporary name, one
I was planning to change since I started writing the story five years
ago.
From now on, it will be known as 'Into the Fray: Hour of Need'.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">12/6/99 - Completed the
Chiddetny People page
under Into the Fray / Tour Guide / Chiddetny.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">11/8/99 - Added a complete
version of the
Chiddetny
Page under Into the Fray / Tour Guide. The Chiddetny People page is
partially
completed, and the Chiddetny Gargantuan page is planned for
construction
next.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#ff8080">10/2/99 - The grand opening
of the Infinite
World
of Wonder.</font></p>
