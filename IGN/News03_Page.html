<p><font color="#009900">8/1/2K - Five new weapon models for Brandy
Hothiegh
have been completed in the past six days. Head on over to Tier
2 of the Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics and take a look. In addition, Tier 3
has
begun.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/27/2K - As Tier 2 of my Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics project draws to a close, I've made a
few change to my schedule. I have decided to make the first movie of
the
tactical guide a lesson on config files, and am setting up my schedule
accordingly.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/19/2K - After completing the Smartskin on
the
skirt of my Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage model, I finally completely
finished
the task. It is been 16 days of some pretty tough work, and I'm now
eight
days behind schedule, but the important thing is that the model is
behind
me.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/15/2K - The textures for my Jatoten Rascot
Battle
Mage model are in. As always, you can see it on the </font><font color="#009900">BJQ2T</font><font color="#009900">
page.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/13/2K - All right, I am now two days behind
schedule, but I finally got the mesh of my Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage
model
finished. The results of my work can be seen on the BJQ2T
page.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/7/2K - I finished the head of my Jatoten
Rascot
Battle Mage model yesterday. This puts me only a day behind schedule on
my BJQ2T
project.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">7/1/2K - It's been a while since my last
update,
and since then, I've gotten quite a bit done on IWOW. The NIS
FTP server was down for a while, preventing me from making any uploads
to this site. After I complained to the good people at NIS about the
problem,
they managed to get me back up to speed. I was also held at bay by a
homework
assignment, but now that this is all behind me, I can move on with the
issues of IWOW. The first tier of my BJQ2T
project is over, but I finished last month behind schedule after being
so far ahead a couple weeks ago. In other news, I temporarily closed
down
the Xiaofauxxish section of IWOW. It will remain closed until I can
develop
a better conlang to replace the old one.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">6/14/2K - My <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2
modeling tutorial</a> opened today. So far, only <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&amp;Bones_Page.html">the
first section</a> of it is up and running, but I will add the other
sections
as my schedule permits.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">6/10/2K - I've decided that today was the day
to replace the graphic in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2
main page</a> with something original. I spent three and a half hours
on
the new image, and I hope you're as happy with it as I am. :)</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#009900">6/9/2K - It's time now for a news
double-whammy.
A few days ago, I finished optimizing the Brandy Hothiegh model for my
future Quake2 tactical guide, Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics. As a demonstration of the creasing I
eliminated in the model, I have provided a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Models/Brandy_Oteigh/Movies/Animation_Tests/BHo_-_Brandy_Dance_-_Test01.avi">three
second clip of Brandy dancing</a>, the first movie file on IWOW, in
fact.
The clip is very basic, so don't expect too much from it. In other
news,
I've just ordered <a href="http://www.hash.com/products/am.asp" target="_top">Animation:
Master 2000, V8.5</a>, and it should arrive at my house in two or three
days. Oh, and don't be surprised if you start seeing <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/" target="_top">Fortunecity</a>
banners on the site. Some of the new pages will have these banners,
because
I have recently expanded IWOW into Fortunecity in order to take
advantage
of their 100 megs of bandwidth.</font></p>
