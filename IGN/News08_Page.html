Just
a couple of minor updates this time. I've overhauled <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Creamy_PPM.html">Creamy
Goodness'</a> Gwahrai Sling. It originally had 285 patches, but I
managed
to cut it down to 112. Also, I've added Chapter 2 to my research
notes for Of
Pandas and People. And, not 15 minutes ago, I realized that I got
the
year wrong on my front page updates, so that this year's updates were
shown
as 2002, but that's now been fixed. No wonder the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
people thought my site was abandoned. :)</font></font></font>

Creamy's Wonderland has been having a bit of down time lately, because
the folks at <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/" target="_top">GameSpy</a>
apparently thought I wasn't updating my site and let it sit too long.
But
thanks to the efforts of rogue13
and bearkub of <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>,
Creamy's Wonderland is back and in full effect, and I have several site
updates in store for you. For the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section of CW, I've fixed the left frame menu, so that all
the
LFM pages of EB showed the Races and Research Notes icons. I've given
the
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Gwahrai</a>
page under <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Races_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Races</a>
a bit of polishing up. I'm also studying a new book for my Research
Notes section, Of
Pandas and People. During the past few days, I also found some time
to do some quick sketches of my latest Evil Blood character <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Jonny-V%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Jonny-V</a>.
As for the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
section, the second section of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Q2
modeling tutorial</a>, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Animations_Page.html">Animations</a>,
is now up. I haven't come up with a lot of the screenshots yet, but I
plan
to get that done as I work on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony
Toponi</a>.</font></font></font>

I'm
pleased to announce that there are two new pages in CW's <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. The long awaited <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Races_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Races</a>
page is finally here, but so far, only the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Gwahrai</a>
page is up. I didn't have time to write down everything I wanted on
that
page, but I'll definitely fix it in a future update.&nbsp; The other
new
page is Research
Notes, a page where I'm now archiving everything I've researched
that
may apply to Evil Blood, and may help me make it a better story. Also,
I've been working a little on my two <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/PPM_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">PPM</a>
works in progress, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Creamy_PPM.html">Creamy
Goodness</a>.</font></font></font>

And now, for the site's first update in nearly five months. There are
two
new works in progress on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/PPM_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">PPMs</a>
page in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
section. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Creamy_PPM.html">Creamy
Goodness</a> is the new name of my Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage model,
and
is finally on its way to becoming a Quake2 PPM. And as promised, the
guy
you voted for in the Kissing the Public's Ass poll, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>
is also in the works. Also, there is a new character profile up on the
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a></font><font color="#000000">_</font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Characters_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Character</a>
page, so say hi to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Jonny-V%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Jonny-V</a>.
The spoiler on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Binky%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Binky's</a>
page has been updated, but you may not care to see it if you have the
extreme
patience to wait until I release the Evil Blood comic, if I ever get to
releasing it.&nbsp; Finally, I made a few minor fixes throughout the
site,
mainly correcting spelling errors.</font></font></font>

On this update of Creamy's Wonderland, I overhauled the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
section's <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Archive_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">news
archive</a>. I basically moved the Follycount
news archive up one directory level, gave it a more appropriate name,
and
added some old news items from the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/PPM_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">PPMs</a>
page.</font></font></font>

I finished the updates to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
profile and spoiler that I started two days ago. Also, I've changed the
way that the old news is organized in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
sections of Creamy's Wonderland. I started on this change by moving the
news on Stardancer's page over to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Characters_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Characters</a>
main page, and removing the old news from Stardancer's spoiler page.</font></font></font>

A few more updates, if you care. First and most obviously, I've picked
out a new wallpaper for CW's front page. It's one that was on this page
years ago, but I liked it enough to give it a second term, if you will.
The page titles have also been fixed, and it's a hell of a lot better
than
seeing 'Welcome to Abode GoLive 5' everywhere you go. I just recently
figured
out how to link this site's files to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/" target="_top">FilePlanet</a>
as opposed to my private site directories, thanks in no small part to
rogue13,
SocialNemmesis,
gauss,
and everyone else at <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
who took the time to help me out. Finally, I've partially updated <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
story. I didn't have time to get all the updates on her page finished,
but I'll definitely rectify that on a future update.</font></font></font>

A couple more minor cosmetic updates, as well as a long overdue page.
As
you might have noticed, I've fixed the transparency problem that gave
the
candles a solid white background. The front page icon in the left frame
menu as been replaced by something a little more pleasing to the eye.
Finally,
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Art_Gallery/Art_Gifts%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Fan
Art</a> section is now available for your viewing pleasure.</font></font></font>

Just a couple of quick fixes to the incomplete update six days ago.
Yesterday,
I uploaded a completed version of the new mural, and today, I finished
its frame. I managed to get the frame to accommodate the counter as
well,
and that turned out to be a nice convenience. The sides of the frame
are
not supposed to be white like that; <a href="http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/alchemy.html" target="_top">GIF
Construction Set</a> somehow sucked the transparency right out of them
while I was animating them, but I'll have them fixed in a future
update.
Also, I've completed a few link fixes throughout the site. (Icon fixes
on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood's</a> main page and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&amp;Bones_Page.html">Mesh
and Bones</a>, and an updated <a href="http://www.divx.com/" target="_top">DivX</a>
link to be exact.)</font></font></font>

Welcome to the new and improved Infinite World of Wonder, or should I
say
Creamy's Wonderland? That's right, this site has been completely
re-done,
and is now easier to navigate through, and simply just looks better. I
didn't have time to make all the updates I was hoping to make, but I
did
get to squeeze in a couple of them. The story for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Binky%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Binky</a>
has been re-written, and there are a few more draft pics of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune</a>
on his page. I've also halted construction on BJQ2T
indefinitely, but will continue to develop the rest of Follycount
behind the scenes. However, I didn't have enough time to finish the new
mural, so I had to settle for an unfinished version. On a future
update,
I'll make the mural more presentable, and I'll even come up with a
snazzy
looking frame for it as well. That's all for now, Rascot out.</font></font></font></p>
