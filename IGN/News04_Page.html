<p><font color="#009900">11/1/2K - Tier
5 of the BJQ2T
project ends with the completion of Scene 5 of the no-frills version of
Config
File Setup. Because of the amount of time and effort no-frills CFS is
taking
me to complete, Tier 6 will include working on release version
elements,
even though I haven't yet finished no-frills CFS.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">10/21/2K - I finished rendering the first of
four
parts of Scene 4 of Config File Setup of BJQ2T
this morning. In order to prevent myself from falling behind in my
schedule
again, I've decided to cut back a little on the no-frills version of
CFS.
Only the first part of Scene 4 will be included in the no-frills
version;
the other three sections will be added in later versions of the episode
during future tiers. I've also been forced to postpone the design of
the
shuttlecar station for the second week in a row. I now have only 11
days
until the end of the month and the end of Tier 5 to finish the last
three
of seven scenes in CFS, and whatever doesn't get finished before then
with
be worked on during future tiers.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">10/16/2K - And now for the most significant
news
this site has seen since its creation just over a year ago. The
Infinite
World of Wonder is now a part of the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com" target="_top">Gamespy
Network</a>, and under <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>'s
umbrella. (You might have noticed the banners by now.) Because of the
bandwidth
they're giving me, and because of their lack of the bullshit policy I
mentioned
about Fortunecity, I am now able to show you those first three scenes
from
the Config File Setup episode of
Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics. The construction of Scene 4 of BJQ2T
is going slower than I'd like it to, so I might have to alter my plans
for the future tiers, but when it's done, I think you'll appreciate the
work I'm putting into it. I'm also changing the modeling style of
BJQ2T,
basing it on the cartoon TV show 'The Critic'.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">10/2/2K - This is my third update in three
days,
and while no significant changes have been made to IWOW since
yesterday,
I felt the need make this announcement anyway. The Infinite World of
Wonder
is now officially one year old, and to celebrate, I've spent the past
six
hours creating the lovely piece of eye candy you see at the top of the
page. That is all.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">10/1/2K - With the completion of the third
scene
of the no-frills CFS movie of my BJQ2T
project,
Tier
4 is finally vanquished. Hopefully, my server problem will be fixed
soon, so I can show you what I've got so far on the project. On to Tier
5 I go!</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">9/29/2K - I've been forced to limit this
month's
completion of the no-frills version of the Config File Setup episode of
Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics to only the first three scenes.
Unfortunately,
I haven't yet found another web hosting service to take the place of
Fortunecity,
but I hope to take care of that by the end of the month.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">9/23/2K - It's been nearly a month since the
last
update of IWOW, and I spent most of this time working on the draft
version
of the Config File Setup episode of Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics. Due to the unexpected level of
difficulty
of this assignment, I've been forced to postpone the other two tasks in
Tier 4 to a later tier. I started school at <a href="http://www.bergen.cc.nj.us" target="_top">Bergen
Community College</a> for the fall a couple weeks ago, and decided to
make
the CFS movie my school project, which puts additional pressure on
getting
this damn thing done. And now some more bad news. Fortunecity now
prohibits
the linking of movie files on their servers from outside pages, which
is
a total bullshit policy IMHO. So until I find another free webspace
provider,
we'll have to get by without being able to view movies on this site. :(
This is especially bad timing, since I finished the first scene of CFS
v0.1 today. So, until the next update, later days.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">8/26/2K - This is a minor update, so I'll make
it quick. I updated the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Links_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">links</a>
section of IWOW, and it now includes two banners. That is all.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#009900">8/25/2K - Tier
3 of the Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics project is now officially completed.
Even
better is the fact that I finished it with six days to spare.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#009900">8/16/2K - I hope you're enjoying the new look
of the front page. The two souls you see in the big pic above is yours
truly holding Candystick, and my adopted elfin daughter, Brandy
Hothiegh,
holding her trusty shotgun, Mr.Bang. In other news, I got my sister to
agree to play the voice for Brandy in my BJQ2T
project. I'm also done with the script of the first movie of the
project.</font></p>
