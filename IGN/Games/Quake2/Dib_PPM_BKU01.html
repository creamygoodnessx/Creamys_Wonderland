<p><font color="#FF8080">> Dib can be thought of as a pre-teen Fox Moulder
from Jhonen Vasquez's <a href="http://gir.n3.net/" target="_top">Invader
Zim</a>. He has an obsession for the paranormal, and is a member of a secret
club of fellow paranormal investigators called the the Swollen Eyeball.
He has no friends whatsoever, and noone takes him or his work seriously,
not even his father, Professor Membrane, or his sister, Gaz. Dib is the
mortal enemy of Zim, a hostile alien of the Irken race, who has come to
Earth to enslave its people, and is disguised as a human boy. Dib is the
only person to know Zim's true identity and his mission, but is unable
to convince anyone else of the truth.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> Invader Zim is one of my favorite shows on TV,
and is a very popular show amongst teens and young adults. Frankly, I'm
surprised noone has ever released a Quake model of one of the show's characters
before now. (I've seen two Gir models, one of Gaz, and one incompleted
model of Zim, but none of them were made into gaming models.) This model
is my way of paying homage to the show, and I hope other models from the
show will eventually follow. Some time ago, I did a poll on CW's front
page of what cartoon character the people would want to see as a Quake2
PPM, and Dib won. I may make a Quake3 version of this model if I find the
time. When Dib is completed, he will use my universal one-handed VWEP,
the same one <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Chuckie_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Chuckie
Finster</a> uses.</font>

For the past two months, I've had all 20 of Dib's animations completed,
except for Crouch Walk. I wanted to have Dib crawl on his belly like an
Army private crawling under a low wire, but I couldn't find the right animation
reference to follow. I finally found a few potential references while looking
over some old tapes of <a href="http://www.netvista.net/~del_grande/arnold.html" target="_top">Hey
Arnold</a> episodes a week ago. Using one of these references, I found
a crawl which was almost as good as the belly crawl I originally wanted,
and decided to settle for it. The resulting animation is the reference's
crawl with my own personal touch to it. The short clip below shows the
completed Crouch Walk, but the actual CW is far less choppy than the clip
suggests.</font></font>

of Crouch Walk, I was finally able to compile all of Dib's animations into
a choreography. I found an extra frame with the Flipoff and Crouch Death
animations, but other than that the compiling went smoothly. This puts
me at the start of the optimization phase of this project, which I will
start soon. As I do Dib's optimizations, I will turn to some ancient notes
I wrote for my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tutorial_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Quake2
PPM modeling tutorial</a> years ago, and will re-write these notes into

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> When I was doing the
Crouch Attack, it dawned on me that since Dib fires his weapon with one
hand while crouching, there would be more of a recoil from this attack
than in his standard standing attack, where he holds the weapon with two
hands. I took another look at Dib's Attack animation, and noticed a violent
recoil that almost caused Dib to fall backwards. Then I realized that the
recoil in Dib's Crouch Attack couldn't exceed the explosive recoil in his
standing attack. So I thought it would make sense to redo the standing
attack, significantly reducing its recoil so that it was less than that
of Crouch Attack. Besides, I thought it might be a good idea to show that
Dib is comfortable in firing his weapon.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">8/1/2003 - This is an
update that should have been made yesterday when I first announced it on
the front page, but somehow I just forgot to put it up here; don't ask.
Anyways, since the last update, I completed three new animations for Dib;
Taunt, Point, and Wave. This brings the total number of completed animation
to twelve out of twenty. While Taunt and Point were only moderately difficult,
the Wave was an absolute bitch.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> Like I did with my
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Chuckie_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Chuckie</a>
and <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tony_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Tony</a>
models, I'm dedicating Dib's wave to his grenade toss. At first, I planned
on having the toss take the form of a baseball pitch, but after I finished
the first keyframe, I decided to change it to what Brandy Otay was going
to use for her own grenade toss. Dib's Hand Grenade model is Brandy's ballflinger,
a throwing device I saw on an episode of <a href="http://disney.go.com/park/homepage/today/flash/index.html" target="_top">Disney's</a><a href="http://www.upn11tv.com/shows/kids/shows/old_shows/weekenders/weekenders.htm" target="_top">The
Weekenders</a>. I used a clip from the show as a reference, and it was
tough to work with, since it only gave me two dimensions to study instead
of three, so I had to resort a lot of guesswork. Below is the reference
clip from The Weekenders next to Dib's finished Grenade Toss animation.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> I realized something
important when I was putting together the clip of Dib's Grenade Toss. I
noticed the flinger was upside-down while he was holding it in his default
Stand frame. At first I thought it was a problem with the constraints that
bind the flinger model to Dib, but then I noticed the Dib's right hand
was turned the wrong way, so that the back of his hand faces the front.
This could mean that I have to adjust all the animations I've made so far
to correct this problem. So what I'll do for CW's next update is make a
choreography with all of Dib's animations, where he holds the flinger in
his right hand. Needless to say, this will hold me back quite a bit, but
I'm still making my final preparations for this year's <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>,
so it might take me a while to make it happen.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/10/2003 - The past
month has given me the chance to do some major upgrades to Dib. Some were
relatively easy, while others were a real pain in the ass. Dib now stands
at 588 patches, and when I did a test conversion of the model into <a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/gmax/" target="_top">gmax</a>,
the polycount came out to be 1029 polygons. Here's the result of all my
hard work on the model...</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> I reworked Dib's torso
in order to make it more SmartSkin friendly. At the middle of the torso,
the mesh now branches off into two parts; the belly, and the shirt. This
upgrade allows Dib to raise his legs without them clipping through the
shirt. Trust me, this was more of a bitch than you think. The top four
pics show what the torso was like before the upgrade, the bottom is after.</font></font>

a two day period on the body (everything except the head) and skeleton,
forsaking sleep, food, and bodily hygene to do so. The model sheet I used
as my rotoscope cheated a bit, so I had to make a few comprimises. My version
of Dib isn't exactly "on model", but I'm happy with it anyway. The model's
final patch count came out to be 587 patches, which I hope will translate
to less than 900 polygons when I export it to <a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/3dsmax/" target="_top">3DS
