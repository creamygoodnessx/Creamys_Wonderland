<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; I became interested
in
the art of modeling Quake 2 plugin player models (PPMs) when I first
visited
the Q2PMP in the middle of 1998. From that moment, I became a PPM
junkie,
collecting good, high quality models wherever I could find them. I
always
wanted to get into PPM modeling myself, and had a few ideas from a few
of my interests in other genres, but lacked the tools and know-how to
do
so. It was the middle of the July of 1999 when I got my first real
break.
After almost a year of searching for the right tutorials and software,
I was finally ready to start my first model, Chuckie Finster.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ffccff">7/1/2007 -</font><font color="#cc66cc"> This will be the final update that I will post on the
Quake2 PPM main page. I've noticed that whenever I make an update to
one of my models, I report it on up to three different pages on the
site, and I'm beginning to think that that's a bit excessive. Model
updates are reported on the front page, and in the build log of the
model I'm updating if the model has one, making reporting on this page
redundant and unecessary. Therefore, I've decided to stop posting
updates on this page, and to let all of the page's updates, including
this one, fall into the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Archive_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2 Archive</a> when their turns come.</font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc"></font></font></p>

<p style="color: rgb(153, 51, 102);"><font face="SpaceOne">10/22/2004 -
Over the past couple weeks, I've been working on the beautification of
the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake 2</a>
section of Creamy's Wonderland. As the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>
model was nearing completion, I thought it would be nice to make the
next
site update a little more special by not only including the new Dib
model,
but also by improving the appearance of the site. The changes I made
consist
mainly of changing the mural on the Quake 2 section's front page,
replacing
the tiny icons for the Quake 2 PPMs with large, trading card-like
icons,
and completely overhauling the PPM pages. I also changed the font of
the Quake 2 pages to one called SpaceOne, which you can get <a href="http://www.themeworld.com/cgi-bin/preview.pl/fonts/spaceone.0.zip" target="_top">here</a>.
You can also get <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/spaceone.ttf">this
copy of the font</a> I have saved locally on my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/" target="_top">PlanetQuake</a>
server.</font>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">3/20/2003 - From this
point
forward, I will post all Quake PPM works in progress on this page, so
that
you can see the progress I'm making with each one. There are two models
for Quake 2 I'm currently working on. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Creamy_PPM.html">Creamy
Goodness</a>, formerly known as Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage, is a model
I completed quite a while back, but only now am I finding the time to
put
it into a game environment. If the updates on the model's page look
familiar,
that's because CG was part of two projects I was doing a while back.
After
I finish CG as a Quake model, I probably won't do any more major work
on
it.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">&gt; Over a year and a
half
ago, I did a poll on the front page of Creamy's Wonderland, asking what
cartoon character you would like to see as a Quake 2 or Quake 3 model.
The
winner of that poll was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a>,
and I'm sure that most people who visit this site regularly (all 12 of
you) were starting to doubt if I'd ever get around to getting Dib into
the arenas. Well, as it turns out, I finally had the chance to do just
that, and you can now see the model as it gets built step by step.</font></font>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">4/28/2001 - Due to some
recent popular demand, I've decided to work on converting my Jatoten
Rascot
Battle Mage model to Quake 2, rather than doing so with Brandy. To tell
you the truth, this 'popular demand' comes in the form of fellow
Polycounter
Frankie, but that's good enough for me. (That's right Frankie, I
haven't
forgotten about you.)</font></font></p>
