<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">12/9/2K (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#CC66CC"> I have a double-whammy for you all today.
Yesterday, I completed <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> no-frills Scene 7. As a result, the draft versions of all
the scenes of CFS are now complete. And if that's not enough of an update
for you, I've applied the voice-overs for the first three scenes this morning,
promoting them to release versions! To accommodate these upgrades, I have
redesigned the Media section of the CFS page. All this good news puts me
halfway through Tier 7, with 10 days to go!</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">12/1/2K (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">And now begins
a new tier. Tier 7 consists of four tasks, and although on average they
aren't too difficult to complete, the shortened deadline in this tier will
keep this a challenge. The stakes are higher than usual, because my 2D
Computer Animation 2 class ends on the 19th, and as you know,
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> is my class project.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">11/29/2K (Follycount)
- </font><font color="#CC66CC">Woah boy, have I got news for you today.
All of the voice-overs for scenes 1 through 3 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> have been recorded. I re-rolled the RTS (race, type, style)
of the Scene 2 sniper yesterday, and determined the model will be a human
male adult in the style of Craig Bartlett's Hey Arnold. In order to take
some of the burden off of this page, I've added a new BJQ2T news archive
section to it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> I've decided to change
the layout of the Goodies pages. Since uploading large files has always
been a bitch for me, I think it might be better if episodes of BJQ2T were
available only in parts. As a result, I've eliminated to Episodes page
of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>, and changed the drafts page's name to 'Media'. This will
make it easier for me to upload the episodes to IWOW, and hopefully, for
you to download them as well.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">11/24/2K (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">The sixth scene
of no-frills <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> is now officially behind me. It took me twenty days to finish,
and I'm two weeks behind schedule, but the important thing is that the
ass-itch is out of the way. My next assignment is acquiring the voice-overs
for the first three scenes of CFS, but that task is already underway.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">11/1/2K (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#CC66CC"> After about a week of hard labor, I've gotten
all six parts of the no-frills version of Scene 5 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a> finished, but I'm going into Tier 6 with two scenes yet
to be completed. It took the use of <a href="http://www.hash.com" target="_top">Animation:
Master</a>, <a href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="_top">Paint Shop Pro</a>,
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_top">Adobe</a>
After Effects, and Adobe Premiere to pull this off. Instead of trying to
complete the entire no-frills CFS in a single tier like I've been trying
to do for the past two tiers, I'll try to focus on one scene of the episode
per tier. This may be a wise decision since Scene 6 of CFS is a seven-parter,
and the final scene of the episode involves something I've never experimented
with before. As for the other tasks in Tier 6, I plan to post a few concept
sketches of the first extra character, and do some of the voice overs for
the first three scenes.</font></font>

- </font><font color="#CC66CC">The BJQ2T Goodies section of IWOW is now
officially up and running. Right now, the pickings are rather slim, as
I only have three draft movies and a script in store. These movies can
be found in a new Drafts section in this page along with any future movies
of the project, and use a DivX compressor, which is the best one I've seen
for when you really need them small. <b><blink>In order to view any of
the movies on IWOW, you must have the DivX compressor installed on your
machine.</blink></b> You can find the compresser at <a href="http://divx.ctw.cc/" target="_top">DivX
;-)</a>. Expect more goodies to come in the future and enjoy! :)</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">10/1/2K (Follycount)
- </font><font color="#CC66CC">Another month, another tier out of the way.
The first three scences of the no-frills version of Config File Setup are
done, however, due to the cruel change in Fortunecity's linking policy,
I'm unable to show you the scenes. I'll probably be able to show you my
work on the project sometime in this new tier (Tier 5), but until then,
please bear with me.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> Since so much of the
project revolves around the completion of the draft version of CFS, I can't
really add anything new in this tier. Most of the other tasks I have planned
are ultimately dependant on the draft, so finishing it is priority number
one.&nbsp; I've decided to cut back even further on the rest of my tasks,
and as a result, the only other task in this tier is the shuttlecar station
design.</font></font>

-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">Due to the
difficulty of the no frills version of Config File Setup, I've decided
to postpone the designs of Catacombs 10 South entrance and the shuttlecar
station until a later tier.</font></font>

- </font><font color="#CC66CC">With the completion of Brandy Hothiegh's
VWEP, I am now finished with <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T/Tier3_Page.html">Tier
3</a>. I am six days ahead of schedule, and will begin the next tier tomorrow.
Combining those six days with the thirty days of next month, I'll have
36 days to finish Tier 4. Since there are three tasks in Tier 4, and since
I'm dividing the workload evenly amongst these tasks, I'll have 12 days
to finish each task. I just hope that I stay this far ahead of my schedule,
or better yet, increase my lead on it even further. Only time will tell.</font></font>
