<br><u><font color="#00FF80"><font size=+2>Step 3: Optimization</font></font></u></center>

<p>> After you finish all 20 of your animations, and are sure that they
have exactly 198 frames altogether, your next goal is to clean it up a
bit for use as a Quake2 PPM. This is called optimization, and covers things
such as making sure your model is the right size, sealing up unwanted holes
in the mesh, and a few other things
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>CENTER, DIRECTION, &amp; SIZE</b></center>

<p>> The first step of the optimization phase of building your PPM is to
make sure your model is standing on the right spot, facing the right way,
and is the right size. In order to do this, we need to compare it to a
completed Quake2 PPM, and use that as a reference to make the appropriate
adjustments to your model. Because Animation: Master does not have very
good import / export support, we can't import a Quake2 PPM in AM, so we
must export your model to Quake Model Editor. We will save it as a 3ds
file, because QME also uses this type of model. However, you can't save
a model as a 3ds until you install the 3dsMax export plugin, which you
can download <a href="ftp://ftp.hash.com/pub/plugins/ImportExport/Windows/3ds/3ds.hie">here</a>
from Hash Inc.'s official FTP site. Once you download the plugin, simply
place it in the IE sub-folder of wherever you installed AM.
<p>In the Project Workspace window, right click your choreography, then
pick Export. If Export is not available, clicking on your model first might
fix this. When giving your model a name in the In the Export Model As window,
save it as a 3ds file, because QME also uses this type of model. If the
3ds file type is not available, then you haven't installed the 3dsMax export
plugin, which you can download <a href="ftp://ftp.hash.com/pub/plugins/ImportExport/Windows/3ds/3ds.hie">here</a>.
When you click OK,&nbsp; you will see a new window named Export Options.
Here, you will be given an option called Polygons Per Patch. At this point,
it won't make too much of a difference which one you choose, because for
now you're only exporting for comparison purposes. I recomend you pick
"1", because this will give you the lowest polygon count. Once you click
OK, you will see yet another window, this one being Frame Range.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>> While this step does not exactly involve optimizing your model, it
is an important bridge between two steps that do, and can be long and tedious.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p><b>ROTOSCOPES</b></center>

<p>> Whenever you build a complex model, it's a good idea to apply rotoscopes
as references to whatever you're attempting to model. If you're modelling
a commercial cartoon character, the best rotoscopes will usually be the
character's official turnaround model sheet. Such an image can be found
on the Internet, or from the official artwork book of whatever show or
movie the character is from (The Making of...). If you can't find any such
official model sheet, you can improvise by capturing screenshots of the
character, and use those as your rotoscope. (Of course, you need access
to a video adapter card or a TV tuner to take screenshots.) This method
can be tricky, because it's not always easy to tell if an angle is exactly
the front, profile, or whatever angle you're trying to capture. Even if
the character is facing the right direction, a slight tilt can throw you
off when used as a rotoscope. So take several shots of each desired angle,
taking your best guess as to what the exact front view, profile, and back
view should look like. As a guide, you can use a turnaround model sheet
of another character to choose the best screenshots. When applying the
rotoscopes, make sure all the angles are consistant with each other. (The
nose on one rotoscope has to be consistent with the nose on the others,
and so must every other part of the character.)
<p>> The ideal rotoscopes you can use for modelling a character in 3D are
full body shots of the exact front, side, back, angles. Sometimes, it may
be helpful to use a top view of the character, but such an angle is usually
not included in an offical model sheet, and is by far the most difficult
find a screenshot of. It's not always possible to find a screenshot of
turnaround model sheet quality (with the character standing upright, with
his/her hands to the side, with both legs straight, shot at the exact angle
desired, and with none of the body cropped out of the shot), but there's
a way to get around this issue. Here's what I do whan I run into this problem.
I take screenshots of the head, torso, and legs, and apply them as separate
rotoscopes. First, I apply the head screenshots as rotoscopes to their
appropriate angles, then build the head portion of the model. Next, I delete
the head rotoscopes, then apply those of the torso, then build the model's
torso. Finally, I follow suit with the legs.

<p><b>MISSING PATCHES</b></center>

<p>> If there is a hole where there should logically be a patch, delete
a spline of the missing patch. Use the Add Lock&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/AddLock.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=32 width=32>
feature to create separate a spline with four control points. Attach the
second control point of this line to a CP of the spline you deleted, and
the third to the other deleted CP. This should cause the patch to appear
properly. You can now delete the first and fourth CP of your new spline.
I have Strykerwolf at Polycount to thank for this method.

<p><b>CREASE REDUCTION</b></center>

<p>> A major ass itch that 3D animators must face is abnormal creasing
in their models while animating them. Fortunately, Animation: Master 99
and all versions following it have a feature called SmartSkin. SmartSkin
allows you to assign control points to particular locations depending on
the rotation of certain bones. Here's how it works...
<p>> During the building of your mesh, make sure you build its joints a
certain way in order for it&nbsp; to take advantage of SmartSkin.

<p><font color="#FF8080">> After applying a skeleton to your model, apply
a SmartSkin to one of your model's bones. Select a bone, right-click it,
and select 'New SmartSkin'. After selecting an axis in which to apply the
SmartSkin on, a new window will open, in which your selected bone will
be bent at a 90 degree angle. In this window, you can manipulate control
points to suit the angle of the bone with a minimum amount of creasing.
After the SmartSkin is applied, it will take effect in all of the model's
animations. Here is a list of the bones and angles I use the SmartSkin
feature on...</font>

<p>> In order to make your model's wrist twist properly while your model's
hands twist, it's a good idea to rotate each ring of splines down the arm
all the way to the shoulder. (This belongs to the Z-Axis of the hands.)
This should be done gradually up the arm. It may take you about an hour
to find the right rotations for each ring of the arm, but patience can
pay off big time.

<p><b>EASY EYELIDS</b></center>

<p>> The SmartSkin can be used to conveniently animate certain parts of
a model where the conventional use of bones isn't practical. For example,
a model's eyelids can be fitted with a SmartSkin so that they can open
and close with the simple movement of a bone. In order to make this work,
a bone must be created for each eyelid. These "eye bones" should be detached
from the rest of the model's skeleton.
<p>> Create a new SmartSkin for the Z-axis of one of the eyelid bones,
and set the axis to 0 degrees. Rotate and translate the eyelid to cover
the eye completely, so that the eye looks like its closed all the way.
(Whenever I first model the eyelids, they are in closed position by default.
So applying their SmartSkin is just a matter of creating a new keyframe
instead of manipulating the control points. Sometimes, I select the eyelid,
then press the up key once, then the down key once just to make sure the
keyframe is created.) Then set the bone's Z-axis to 179 degrees, and manipulate
the control points of the eyelid so that the lid is turned upward just
above the eye, and buried completely inside the head. If the SmartSkin
is applied correctly, turning the Z-axis during one of the model's animations
should cause the eyelid to open and close; the lower the number of the
Z-axis, the more closed the eye will be, the higher the number, the more
open. If you notice any irregular movement of the eyelid, it can probably
be fixed by setting a half-open value on its Z-axis at 90 degrees. Of course,
you will have to repeat the entire process on the other eyelid.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_01.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_01.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>The
blue and pink bones you see, which are parallel with the eyes, are the
Left and Right Eye Dials, which will control the opening and closing of
the eyelids. Notice that in the Project Workspace, they are independent
from the Pelvis tree.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Right
click on one of the eye dials, and in the this case, it will be the Right
Eye Dial. Select New SmartSkin, then Z-Rotate. A new window will open.
This is where you will create the SmartSkin.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_03.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_03.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>The
number on the frames scroll bar indicates the value of the Z-axis, and
will start at 90 degrees. Set this value at 0 degrees, and move the control
points of the right eyelid, so that it covers the eye completely. If the
control points are already in place, select all the control points for
the eyelid, then press up on the keyboard once, then down once. This will
ensure that a keyframe is created for the 0 degree value of the SmartSkin.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_04.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_04.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Now,
set the Z-axis to 179, and rotate and translate the eyelid, so that most
or all of it is buried inside the head, just above the eye. This should
give the appearance that the eye is open.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_05.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE1_05.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Finally,
in order to create a middle ground between your SmartSkin's two keyframes,
set the Z-axis to 90, and manipulate the eyelid so that the eye is exactly
half open. It is often necessary to go back and forth between the 179 and
90 keyframes to make further adjustments to the eyelid, so that it opens
and closes smoothly.

<p>> Fo<font color="#FF8080">r my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>
mod</font>el, I used a different method for the eyelid SmartSkins than
my other models. In the case of most of my models, the eyes are part of
the model's skin, and the eyelid moves to cover and uncover it. I find
it easiest to initially model the eyelids in the closed position, because
this position needs to be modelled more accurately than the open position.
(When closed, the eyelid needs to be the right size and shape to cover
the eyes completely, and be only as big as it needs to be. When open, the
eyelid will be hidden inside the head, and doesn't have to be as accurate
as when it's closed.) However, in the case of the Dib model, I initially
modelled the eyes in the open position. Dib has no eyelids, but instead,
the eye itself is a separate part of the face which changes shape based
on how open or closed it is. Each eye also includes a 6 patch segment that
shows the eye in its fully closed position, and this segment is buried
within the head until needed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_01.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_01.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Because
the default position of Dib's eyes is open, I started with a Z-axis setting
of 179. Like my other models, I created the keyframe by selecting the control
points of the eye, then pressing up once, then down once.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>At
the 90 degree mark, I pulled the top part of the eye down, close to the
middle of the eye.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_03.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_03.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>At
the 1 degree mark, I pulled the bottom part of the eye up, close to the
middle of the eye. This gives Dib a squinting look, and the eye is almost
closed. I also made a keyframe of the closed eye segment on this frame,
still buried in the head.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_04.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/EE2_04.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>At
the 0 degree mark, I buried the eyeball within the head, and brought out
the closed eye segment.

the keyframes of the SmartSkin are completed, I straightened all of its
curves in order to eliminate any awkward in-between frame activity. I did
this by making sure no control points were selected, and then I went into
Edit Channels&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Edit_Channels.gif" NOSAVE height=24 width=24>.
I selected all of the control points in the Channels window, and in the
