<br><u><font color="#00FF80"><font size=+2>Step 3: Optimization</font></font></u></center>

<p>> After you finish all 20 of your animations, and are sure that they
have exactly 198 frames altogether, your next goal is to clean it up a
bit for use as a Quake2 PPM. This is called optimization, and covers many
areas such as making sure your model is the right size, sealing up unwanted
holes in the mesh, and a few other things as well.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>CENTER, DIRECTION, &amp; SIZE</b></center>

<p>> The first step of the optimization phase of building your PPM is to
make sure your model is standing on the right spot, facing the right way,
and the right size. In order to do this, we need to compare it to a completed
Quake2 PPM, and use that as a reference to make the appropriate adjustments
to your model. Because Animation Master does not have very good import
/ export support, we can't import a Quake2 PPM into AM, so we must export
your model to a format that can be opened in Quake Model Editor. We will
save it as a 3ds file, because QME uses this type of model. However, you
can't save a model as a 3ds in AM until you install the 3dsMax export plugin,
which you can download
<a href="ftp://ftp.hash.com/pub/plugins/ImportExport/Windows/3ds/3ds.hie">here</a>
from <a href="ftp://ftp.hash.com/pub/" target="_top">Hash Inc.'s official
FTP site</a>. Once you download the plugin, simply place it in the IE sub-folder
of wherever you installed AM.
<p>> Before you begin exporting your model, make sure that your frames
are shown by their current cell number, so that Frame 1 is displayed as
"1". To do this, go to the Tools menu, and choose Options. In the Units
tab, there will be a section called "Show time as". Make sure "Cell number
(1)" is selected, then click OK.
<p>> In the Project Workspace window, right click your choreography, then
pick Export. If Export is not available, opening a window in your Choreography
first might fix this. When giving your model a name in the in the Export
Model As window, save it as a 3ds file. If the 3ds file type is not available,
then you haven't installed the 3dsMax export plugin. Just remember to restart
AM after installing the plugin in order for it to take effect. When you
click OK, you will see a new window named Export Options. Here, you will
be given an option called Polygons Per Patch. At this point, it won't make
too much of a difference which one you choose, because for now you're only
exporting for comparison purposes. I recommend you pick "1", because this
will give you the lowest polygon count. Once you click OK, you will see
yet another window, this one being Frame Range. For both the Start and
End values, enter "1". Doing so will export only the first frame of your
model, which is fine for now. Since we are only dealing with one frame,
the Step value doesn't matter. Once you click OK, your model's first frame
will be saved as a 3ds model, and will be ready for use in QME.

sure the 3dsMax export plugin (3ds.hie) exsists in your Animation Master
/ IE directory.

order to avoid confusion later on, make sure that your frames are shown
by their current cell number. Access the Units tab by going to the Tools
menu, then choosing Options.

the Frame Range window, set Start to "1", and End to "1", so that only
the first frame of your model's animation gets exported.
<center>
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/rule02.gif" NOSAVE height=22 width=468></center>

<p>> Now it's time to load your model into Quake Model Editor, and compare
it to an official Quake2 model so you can correctly adjust your model for
use as a PPM. Open QME, but don't close Animation Master yet. Import your
newly created 3ds file by going to the File menu, Import, Import Append
Verts. When the Import File For Editing window comes up, open your 3ds
model, which will probably have a 0 added to its filename. If your model
doesn't show up on screen, it could be severely off-center or too small.
If this is the case, you can pan and zoom your views by turning on the
Pan Views&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Pan_Views.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=19 width=58>
button on the lower-right corner of the screen. Once on, moving your pointer
over the views should turn it into a hand. You can rotate the view by going
to the upper-right view, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging
the mouse around. To pan the camera, go to any other view, hold down the
left mouse button and drag. In order to zoom, go to any view, hold down
the right mouse button, and move the mouse up to zoom in, or down to zoom
out. But if your original model is already centered in AM2000 and not microscopic,
you should be able to see it just fine in QME.
<p>> Now we're going bring in the comparison model. In this case, we'll
pick the Male model, because it comes with Quake2, and it's guaranteed
be a good reference. Go to the File menu, Choose Reference Model. This
will open up a window called Open File For Editing, from which you can
find and open Quake2's Male model. This model is called tris.md2, and can
be found in baseq2/players/Male in the folder where Quake2 is installed.
Once you open tris.md2, you should see it in your upper-right view, along
with your model.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/IAV.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/IAV.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
QME, open your one-frame 3ds by going to the File menu, and then Import,
and Import Append Verts.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Four_Views01.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Four_Views01.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>You
should see your model in all four views.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/CRM.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/CRM.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Open
Quake2's default Male model as your reference model. Under the File menu,
pick Choose Reference Model. In the Quake2/baseq2/players/Male folder,
open tris.md2.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Four_Views02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Four_Views02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>You
should see Male in the 3D view along with your model.
<center>
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/rule02.gif" NOSAVE height=22 width=468></center>

<p>> The next step is to adjust the position, direction, and size of your
model, using the Male model as your reference. Now, you're probably thinking
that this is done in QME, but it's actually a job for Animation Master.
Go to the first frame in your Choreography, and click on your model in
the Choreography. Using the open QME window as a guide, adjust the direction
of your model. Don't worry about the position or size of your model just
yet; we'll do each in turn. When adjusting the direction of your model
in AM, just remember that the lower-left view in QME is the front view
by default. Also remember that the upper-left view is the top view by default,
and in this view, your character should be facing the bottom of the screen.
In fact, if you know this, you don't need the reference model to correctly
adjust your character's direction. If your model is facing forward in Animation
Master, it should be facing to the left in QME. In order to fix this, go
to your character's first frame in the Choreography window in AM, and in
the Properties window, go to the Rotate tab, and choose to edit angle as
Euler. Entering "90" in the Y field should cause your character to make
a quarter-turn to the left. However, this will only happen to the Stand
animation. Go to the first frame of each of the other animations in the
Choreography, and set their Rotate Y value to 90, until all of your animations
face the right way. Run through the frames and verify that everything's
OK, then save your Choreography. Export your Choreography again in the
same way as before. Start a new file in QME, but make sure not to save
your model when prompted. Open the new 3ds in QME. If you don't start a
new file before re-opening the new 3ds, you will see both versions of the
model at the same time, and this will double your model's polycount. If
the model faces the bottom of the screen in the top view, and faces towards
you in the front view, then it's turned the right way.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/JTHM_Top.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/JTHM_Top.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
QME, the upper-left window shows the top of your model. A correctly oriented
model will face the bottom of the screen in this view.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/JTHM_Front.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/JTHM_Front.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>The
lower-left window shows the front of your model. If your model is facing
you in this view, it's facing the right way.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rot_Dif.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rot_Dif.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Models
in QME are oriented a quarter turn clockwise of models in AM. Because of
this, your model may be facing the left side of the screen in the upper-left
view of QME.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Frame1_Sel.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Frame1_Sel.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
AM, make sure you're in the first frame of your choreography, and that
your model is selected.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix01.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix01.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
the Properties window, go to the Rotate tab. Make sure that Edit Angle
As is set to Euler. Entering "90" in the Y field should cause your character
to make a quarter turn counter-clockwise.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>All
frames of Stand should now be facing the right way. However, the rest of
the animations are still oriented incorrectly. Go to the first frame of
Run and make the same correction by entering "90" in the Y field.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix03.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Rotate_Fix03.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Repeat
the process with the rest of the animations.

re-exporting you model's first frame as a 3ds, be sure to start a new model
in QME, but do not save the old model when prompted.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100>If
your model is facing the bottom of the screen in the upper-left window,
and facing forward in the lower-left view, then it's facing the right way.
<center>
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/rule02.gif" NOSAVE height=22 width=468></center>

<p>> The next thing to do is to make sure your model is standing in just
the right spot, and that its feet are on the floor. This would be a lot
easier if the reference model showed up in all four views, but we only
have the upper-right perspective view to work with. In Animation Master,
if your model's feet are on the 0 mark of the Y axis, the model should
appear to be hovering above the ground in QME. If you built your model
so that it's centered on the X and Z axises in AM, it should be centered
in the same way in QME as well. If so, all you really need to do is adjust
model's vertical position in the Choreography.
<p>> In Animation Master, turn off the Key Skeletal Rotations&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/KSR.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=22 width=23>
option by clicking on its icon. Select the model, and click the Edit Channels&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Edit_Channels.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=24 width=24>
icon. If the Edit Channels window does not come up, skip ahead to the next
paragraph. A graph will appear, and you should see a single green line
with many control points along it. To the left of the graph should be a
list, and only Y-Translate should be under your model's shortcut. Draw
a box around all of the control points in the line except for the first
point, delete them, then close the Channel window. Deleting these control
points will ensure that when you move model in the first frame to its correct
position, all frames in your model will follow suit. If you had left the
Key Skeletal Rotations option on when you deleted the control points, your
model would have turned back in the direction it was facing before you
corrected it.
<p>> Now, we are ready to correct the position of your model. In QME, rotate
the perspective view so that the Male model's feet line up vertically.
This should give you an idea of where the floor is going to be. Back in
Animation Master, make sure you're on the first frame of your Choreography.
Select your model and go to any view except the bottom or the top. Using
the views in QME as a reference, adjust your model's position in AM, so
that its feet in QME are in the same vertical position as that of the Male
model; that is, so that it stands on the same floor as Male. If your model
is centered on the X and Z axises, you probably want to make sure your
model moves only up and down, and not to the sides. You can do this by
locking the Y axis; simply hold down the number 2 key, then drag the model
into position. Mercifully, you only have to do this for the first frame,
and all others should follow suit automatically. Once you've guessed where
the floor is in QME, re-export the Choreography as a 3ds in the same way
as before. Re-import the 3ds in QME and note its position. Continue to
fine tune the model in AM, and to export it to QME after each adjustment.
Just remember to make the Choreography 1 frame long in AM, and to clear
the old 3ds files in QME with each adjustment. If you still need to center
your model on the floor, go to QME and turn on Show Origin in the Options
menu. This will cause a plus sign to show up on three of your views. Your
model's feet should be centered on either side of this plus sign. Once
the model is standing on the floor and centered, only the size adjustment
will remain. Now would be a good time to save your choreography.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Male_Ref.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Male_Ref.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>The
reference model in the 3D view is standing in the correct spot; It is centered
in the bounding box, and it's standing exactly on the floor. This is where
your model should be standing.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100>Turn

QME, rotate the 3D view so that you're looking at the reference model exactly
from the side. Male's feet should line up, one passing exactly in front
of the other.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/AM_Front.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/AM_Front.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Back
in AM, go to first frame of your choreography, make sure your model is
selected, and switch to any view except Bottom or Top.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust01.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust01.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>If
your model is already centered on the X and Z axises, you need only to
move it up and down. Hold down the 2 key as you make your adjustment, and
using the 3D view in QME, guess where your model's feet will touch the
ground.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Re-export
the first frame of your model as a 3ds, and in QME, start another new model
without saving the old one. Check your model's feet against that of Male.
Go back into AM, and fine tune the model's position, then re-export.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust03.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Y_Adjust03.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Repeat
the adjustments until the bottom of your model's feet are vertically lined
up with the bottom of Male's feet.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Origin_Center.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Origin_Center.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>If
your model in not certered on the X or Z axis, go to the Options menu in
QME and select Show Origin. A plus sign should appear in three of the views.
Adjust your model so that the plus in the top view is directly between
the feet.
<center>
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/rule02.gif" NOSAVE height=22 width=468></center>

<p>> The only thing left to adjust now is the size of your model. The goal
is to make your model between one head smaller and one head taller than
Male. When your model eventually becomes a playable Quake2 PPM, it will
be surrounded by an invisible box called the bounding box. Players can
hit other players only if they hit this bounding box, and the actual size
of the model is ignored. The bounding box is the same size, no matter how
big or small your model is. If you make your model a giant, and a player
hit a part of the model that's outside the bounding box, it doesn't count
as a hit. If the model is tiny, it will be hit if a shot hits its bounding
box, even if the shot misses the model. So your goal here is to make your
model a reasonable fit for the bounding box.
<p>> In Quake Model Editor, rotate the perspective view so that the bottom
of your model's feet line up with the bottom of Male's feet. If your model
is currently taller than Male (it most likely is), make a note of how high
the top of Male's head is to your model. In Animation Master, make sure
you're on the first frame in the Choreography window, and click on the
vertical ruler on the left side of the window. An arrow should appear on
the ruler, as well as a horizontal line, which should span the length of
the window. This is called a marker. Now, decide how tall you want your
model to be. If you want your model to be as tall as Male, adjust the marker
so that it points to the same spot on your model where the top of Male's
head is in QME. If you want your model to be taller or shorter than male,
adjust the marker to where you want the top of your model's head to be
next to Male. Then, select your model in AM, grab one of the corners of
the selection box, and drag it so that your model's hieght matches that
of the marker. Export the file as a 3ds and compare it to Male, the same
as you've been doing before. Fine tune the model if necessary, then save
your choreography again.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Suggested_Height.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Suggested_Height.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
order for your model to be a fair fit for Quake2's bounding box, it should
be between one Male head shorter and one Male head taller than Male.

QME, rotate the 3D view so that the bottom of your model's feet are lined
up vertically with the bottom of Male's feet. Observe where the top of
Male's head is positioned next to your model.

AM, go to your choreography's first frame, and place a horizontal marker
where the top of Male's head was on your model in QME. Adjust the height
of the marker depending on how tall your model will be in Quake2.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Scale_Fix03.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Scale_Fix03.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>Select
your model and resize it by grabbing one of the box's corners and dragging

<p><b>ANIMATION EXPORT</b></center>

<p>> While this step does not directly involve optimizing your model, it
is an important bridge between the steps that do. If this step is not done
correctly, it can lead to trouble later on. The goal here is to export
all 198 frames of your model into the 3ds format, a type of model that
can be read in Quake Model Editor. After this step, you may not need Animation
Master for the rest of the project, depending on weather or not you want
to build a custom VWEP for your model.
<p>> In Animation Master, export your model as a 3ds file again. However,
this time in the Frame Range window, make sure Start is set to "1", End
to "198", and Step to "1". This will export every frame from 1 to 198 without
skipping any frames. As for Polygons Per Patch, I strongly recommend you
choose "1", since this will give you the lowest polygon count. <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/" target="_top">Polycount</a>
suggests a polygon count of 800 or less for a Quake2 model in order to
preserve game performance. Keep in mind that this exporting process will
save each frame as a separate numbered file from 0 to 197, so it may be
a good idea to put them in their own folder. The process of exporting all
198 frames may take several minutes, so this would be a good time to take
a break.
<p>> ONCE YOU EXPORT YOUR MODEL TO THE 3DS FORMAT, YOU CANNOT RE-IMPORT
IT BACK INTO ANIMATION MASTER. Any changes you want to make to the model's
mesh or animations will have to be done in Quake Model Editor. If you insist
on doing these changes with AM, you will have to change the original model,
and then repeat all of the steps after that all over again. So before you
export all of your frames, you better make damn sure you don't want to
later go back and change anything. Once all frames have been exported,
you can close Animation Master.
<p>> The next step is to change the names of your 3ds files in order to
ensure that they are loaded in the correct order when you import them into
Quake Model Editor. If you were to try to import them now by alphabetical
order, the frames would load into QME in the following order; 0, 1, 10,
100, 101, 102, etc. This is obviously not what you want. A solution could
be to import the files in chronological order, but the files may not have
been exported exactly in this order, so this again would lead to your files
being imported into QME in the wrong order. In order to fix this problem,
make sure that there are exactly three digits in the numbered portion of
the filename of each 3ds file. If the name of my model was Dib, the file
"Dib15.3ds" would become "Dib015.3ds", and "Dib7.3ds" would become "Dib007.3ds".
Anything above 100 would be left alone since they already have three digits.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/FR02.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/FR02.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
AM, export your model as a 3ds again, but this time in the Frame Range
window, set Start to "1", and End to "198", so that now all of your frames
get exported. Make sure that Step is set to "1".

<p>> Go to whatever directory you exported your files into, and count how
many 3ds files you exported. If you have exactly 198 files, the export
was a success, and you can skip this section. Otherwise, you're probably
using the original version of Animation Master 2000. After some experimenting,
I've realised that AM2000 v8.0 has a problem with exporting long series
of files. Every time I tried to export my Quake2 Dib model as a series
of 3ds files, it would give one frame its correct name, but then give the
next frame the same name as the one before it, overwriting the old file.
AM would follow the exact same pattern every time I tried the export, so
that the same frames would be overwritten each time. At first, I thought
it was the Dib Choreography which was at fault. But when I exported another
Choreography as a series of 3ds files, I got the same errors in the same
exact spots. Here's the method I used to get around this problem.
<p>> In my notebook, I wrote down all of the numbers of my frames, from
0 to 197, a list that spanned four pages. I deleted all of the 3ds files
of my Dib model, then went back to Animation Master, and re-exported my
model as a series of 3ds files, but this time I did it an average of 30
frames at a time. Each time I exported a series of files, I would choose
which frames I wanted to be exported in the Frame Range window, just like
I've been doing before. But before doing so, I made sure that my frames
were displayed by the elapsed frames, rather than the current cell number.
Remember, files are always exported from Animation Master by elapsed frames
(Frame 1 is displayed as "0"), regardless of how the frames are displayed.
(In order to display the frames this way, I went to the Tools menu, selected
Options, and clicked on the Units tab. In the "Show time as" section, I
picked "Frames Elapsed (0)"). This way, the filenames matched the number
of each frame. As each frame was being rendered, I marked them off in my
book by placing a check where the correct frames were being rendered. Whenever
a frame was being saved as the wrong name, I wrote the number of the correct
frame next to the number of the frame that it should have been named. For
example, Frames 117 to 124 were being saved correctly, but Frames 125 to
127 were being saved as the previous frames, overwriting them. Frame 128
and all others after it were correctly named. So I wrote a 124 next to
125, 125 next to 126, 126 next to 127, while every other number had a check
next to it. After making sure my filenames each had three digits in their
frame numbers, I solved my frame problem by correctly renaming the following
files; "Dib126.3ds" to "Dib127.3ds", "Dib125.3ds" to "Dib126.3ds", "Dib124.3ds"
to "Dib125.3ds". Because Frame 124 was originally exported correctly, but
then overwritten by Frame 125, which I later renamed correctly, I had to
then re-export the real Frame 124 by entering "124" in both the Start and
End fields in the Frame Range window. The problem happened again when Frame
63 overwrote Frame 62. So I fixed it by renaming "Dib062.3ds" to "Dib063.3ds",
and then re-exporting Frame 62. Since the newly exported file (Dib62.3ds)
now had two digits in its frame number, I fixed this by renaming it "Dib062.3ds".

<p>> After your 198 files have been exported successfully, and they're
all numbered with three digits, it's time time to compile them into a single
md2 file. Md2 is the type of model that Quake2 uses. At this point, you
may close Animation Master if you haven't done so already. Open Quake Model
Editor, and bring in your model's mesh. Do this by going to the File menu,
then choosing Import, then Import Append Verts. When the Import File For
Editing window comes up, go to the directory where you saved your 3ds files,
and pick any one frame of your model's 3ds series, then click Open. This
should cause your model to appear. Now, we're going to import your model's
animations. Go to File, Import, Import Append Frames to once again bring
up the Import File For Editing window. When it does, make sure your files
are listed in alphabetical order. Single-click the last frame of your 3ds
series, hold down the Shift key, and then click on the first frame of the
series. In the Filename text box, you should see the names of the first
few 3ds files in your series. When you click Open, your frames should be
opened in the correct order. If you selected the first frame first and
the last frame last, the last frame would have been opened first, followed
by the first, and then the rest of the frames.
<p>> Once your frames are all loaded into QME, use the horizontal scroll
bar at the bottom of the screen to cycle through your frames, and check
to see if your frames imported correctly. If so, then delete the very first
frame, which should be the one you saw when you imported your verts, and
should be numbered "0" and labeled as "Frame 1". To delete the frame, make
sure it's the one you see on screen, then go to the Edit menu, and choose
Delete Current Frame. When asked "Are you Sure?", click OK. Your model
should now have 198 frames, from 0 to 197. To save your model as an md2
file, go to the File menu, then Export, then Export to MD2. In the Export
to MD2 File window, give your model a name, and pick a folder to save it
to. After you click Save, another window will appear, labeled simply as
Open. This window will ask you to provide a pcx image, but since we haven't
built any skins yet, just make up any name and then click Open. Your model
and its animations are now a single md2 file, but it's far from being an
official Quake2 PPM.
<p>> On the upper-left of screen, there are four tabs, each marked with
a single letter; C, M, B, and V. If you want to see your model's animations,
click on the V tab to expose a section called Play Cam. To see a certain
frame range of your model in motion, enter the last frame of the range
in the To text box, and the first frame in the From box. When you press
the Play Cam button&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Play_Cam.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=18 width=63>
the model in your Perspective view will repeatedly cycle through the frames
you picked, and another press of the button will stop the animation. The
FPS text box sets your frames per second; a higher setting will result
in a slower animation, while a lower setting will make the animation go
faster. The default FPS is 10, which is how fast Quake2 runs its PPMs.
If you want to see your character run continuously, set To to 45 and From
to 40, then click Play Cam.

<p><b>FLIPPING NORMALS</b></center>

<p>> I was working on my Dib model as I wrote the Animations section and
everything after it. Dib is an extremely complex model with many segments,
making it an ideal model to demonstrate the process I use when building
a Quake2 PPM. I figure that if I can accurately explain my process with
Dib as my example, following my tutorial to build a simpler model should
be a piece of cake. I used to flip normals with a pirated copy of 3DSMax
I once owned, and then do the rest of the optimizing in Quake Model Editor.
However, I've recently discovered how to do the optimization fairly easily
in QME alone. Here's my current method of flipping normals in QME.
<p>> In any polygon-based 3D modelling program such as Quake Model Editor,
(as opposed to a spline-based program like Animation Master,) a polygon
is a three or four sided flat shape. In QME and Quake2, all polys have
exactly three sides. The sides of a polygon are called edges, and the corners
are called verts. A single-sided polygon has only one solid surface, and
is only visible when viewed from that surface; if you were to try to look
at the polygon from the opposite side (the backface), it would be invisible.
A polygon's normal is an indicator of which surface is solid, and when
that normal is flipped, the other side of the poly will become solid while
the original side will become invisible. In order to show the model with
both surfaces of its polygons showing, activate Draw Backfaces by going
to the Options menu, and the 3D view, Draw Backfaces. Or, you can just
press D on the keyboard. One drawback about QME is that it doesn't allow
you to select a poly by clicking on its backface, even when Draw Backface
mode is activated. 3DSMax could do this, which is why I used it to flip
my models' normals.
<p>> Since QME has a rather dark color scheme, it may help to change the
colors to make it easier to work. Go to the Options menu, then select Configure.
Click on the Colors tab, and you should see a list with a bunch of colored
squares in it. I find it helpful to make the 3D Background white, the 3D
Face bright green, and both Face Selections bright yellow. Switching from
the default black 3D background will help you tell the difference between
the background and particularly dark polys. Just be sure not to make the
3D Wireframe or the 3D Face the same color as the 3D Background, because
that would of course, make your model invisible.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/3D_Dark.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/3D_Dark.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>QME's
default color settings can be confusing to work with. When the brown polygons
are viewed at certain angles, it can be difficult to tell them appart from
the black 3D background.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Config_Colors.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/Config_Colors.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>In
order to change to color settings, go to the Options menu, and then to
Configure. Click on the Colors tab, and in this screen, you can easily
configure the colors of QME.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/3D_Light.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/3D_Light.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=100 width=100></a>It's
a good idea to select a color scheme that provides maximum contrast between
the background and the darker polygons. Bright green against a white background
works really well.

<p>> Make sure you're in Face mode when flipping your model's normals.
You can switch to this mode by clicking the Face button on the lower-left
corner of the screen. The easiest way to flip the normals in your mesh
is to work on it one section at a time. In order to do this, you must have
only the section you're working on visible, while everything else is hidden.
When isolating a single group, I find it easier to display the 3D view
in Wireframe mode (Options menu, 3D View, Wireframe), and to activate Draw
Backfaces. To select polygons, click on any tab in the upper-left corner
of the screen except for C, and click the Select button. To select individual
polys, simply click on any polys you want to select, and if you want to
de-select a poly, click on it while holding the Alt key. To select a group
of polys, click and drag within one of the viewpoint windows to draw a
box. Any polys that have at least one of their verts inside the box will
be selected. To de-select all polygons, press the / key.
<p>> Remember, you have to click the Pan Views button every time you want
to adjust the camera view, and click Select again to go back to selecting
polys. In order to hide certain polys from view, click on the V tab. You
will
see three buttons, Hide Selected, Hide UnSel, and Unhide All. These buttons
are self explanatory; Hide Selected will make all currently selected polygons
disappear, Hide UnSel will hide all non-selected polys, and Unhide All
will make all polys visible again. When a polygon is hidden, it's not really
gone, just invisible. There are two ways to isolate a group of polys. You
can select all of the polys in the group and click Hide UnSel, or you can
select everything else and click Hide Selected. This is not always as easy
as it sounds; some groups are partially buried inside of other groups,
especially in the case of segmented models. Other groups can be completely
buried inside the model, and only pop out on frames in which they're needed.
If I come across a particularly difficult group to isolate, I select the
parts of the model that surround the group while the entire model fits
into one of the viewpoints. I do this by drawing a box around these parts,
being careful not to select any polys of the group I want to isolate. I
often use more than one view when making my selections. I then click Hide
Selected, which will leave only my target group, plus the polys which are
more difficult to get to. In order to select these, I zoom in extremely
close to them, and draw a box around just one corner of each currently
unwanted poly, making sure I don't catch the corners of any polys I want
to remain visible. When only the group I want to modify is unselected,
I click Hide Selected again. Sometimes, it helps to change frames to make
the selection of certain polygons easier.

<p>> Once you have hidden everything except for the section of the model
you want to work on, check the section to see if any of its normals need
to be flipped. In order to make your work easier, display the model in
Flat Shaded mode (Options menu, 3D view, Flat Shaded). A good way to check
your normal orientation is by using the Draw Backfaces option. If the exterior
of the model looks the same with the backfaces drawn than without, that
usually means the model's normals are facing the right way. Another way
to check is to zoom inside the model with Draw Backfaces turned off. If
you see any polys that should be facing outward, then they may not be seen
from the outside. While still inside the model, click on all of the polys
you can see on all sides to select them. Then, go outside of the model
and press the D key to see the backfaces. If the selected polys only appear
when the backfaces are shown, they are facing the wrong way and need to
be flipped. In order to flip your polys' normals, click the M tab to expose
a button labeled "Flip Normals". With the Select button activated, select
the polys you want to reverse, and then click Flip Normals. When all of
the polys in the section are oriented correctly, go back to the V tab and
click UnHide All to make your whole model visible again. Continue to flip
your model's normals section by section until all normals are facing the
right way. Mercifully, the normal orientation is universal for all the
frames in your md2, so correcting the normals in one frame will do so for
all of them.

I check to see if the normals are correct by looking at the head as I turn
Draw Backfaces on and off. When DB is off, some of the polys disappear.

<p><b>DOUBLE-SIDED POLYGONS</b></center>

<p>> Sometimes, a section will need to have both of its surfaces solid
in order to show up correctly. This is usually the case if your model has
any paper-thin sections, such as a cape. As you should know by now, if
your model's cape is built with only with single sided polys, it would
appear to be perfectly normal from the back, but appear to have a large
section missing when viewed from the front, assuming it's visible at all
from this angle. In order to make both sides of a thin section visible,
you will have to build new polys over the backfaces of the old ones. Before
you begin, it may be a good idea to isolate the polys you want to work
on by hiding the rest of your model.
<p>> When creating backfaces for your model, you must click the C tab on
the upper-left corner of the screen. This should expose four buttons, including
Build Face. Also, it helps if you view the model in Wireframe mode. To
build a backface on the other side of an already existing face, make sure
Draw Backfaces is turned off, and click the Build Face button. This should
cause the cursor to change. Then click on one of the verts of the backface
you want to build, then click the other two verts in a counter-clockwise
motion. Make sure there are no un-hidden verts behind the ones you're selecting,
because you may accidently select those instead. If the blue line that
appears after you click the first vert looks like its not anchored to the
vert, right-click to cancel the building of the face, and try again. If
you were to click the verts going clockwise, a face would be built on the
side you're facing, so that you'd have two faces on the same side of a
poly, and this would never do you any good. To check if the backface was
built, click Pan Views and rotate the camera to the other side of the polygon,
making sure Draw Backfaces is still off. If you see the backface from this
side, and it's attatched to the same verts as its counterpart on the other
side, the backface was built successfully. If the new poly is not connected
correctly or is backwards, simply hit the delete key to get rid of it.
When asked to delete any isolated verts, answer yes. If you run into a
poly that consistantly attatches to the wrong verts, delete the polygon,
zoom in close and try again, and if the problem still persists, try changing
the camera angle a little bit. Keep building the section's backfaces in
this manner until they're all in place.

<p><b>MESH HOLES AND EXTRA POLYS</b></center>

<p>> After you are sure that all of you model's polygons are facing the
right way, and all your desired backfaces have been built, it's time to
do the final steps of your model's optimization. If there are still holes
in your model where there shouldn't be any, you can patch them up by building
new faces over them. Click on the C tab to access the Create Panel. Go
into Wireframe mode, and zoom in on your model's unwanted hole, making
sure you're on the side where you want the patch to be visible. Click on
the Build Face button, and then click the three verts which immediately
surround the hole in a clock-wise motion. Go into Flat Shaded mode and
check to see if the hole was patched properly. If not, delete the new polygon,
hide whatever polys are behind the hole, then try again.

<p>> When you build a model in Animation Master and then export it to a
polygon based format, there are likely to be a number of unwanted extra
polys buried within the model. These polys do not show up in any of your
model's animation frames, and needlessly add to your model's polygon count.
In all of the Quake2 PPMs I've worked on, I've always seen the most extra
polys within the head and hands. In order to get rid of them, isolate a
section of the model, and hide everything else in the same way as we've
been doing before. Go into Flat Shaded mode and turn off Draw Backfaces.
Also, make sure you're in Faces Mode, and that all polys are unselected.
Then, click on each poly of the group, selecting all the visible polys
one at a time. Click on the V tab if you're not already in the V panel,
then click on Hide Selected. All visible faces should disappear, revealing
any hidden poly within. If the are hidden polys, select them all by drawing
a box around them, but don't delete them just yet. Click on UnHide All
to make the entire model visible again. Use the horizontal scroll bar at
the bottom of the screen to cycle through your animations, and thoroughly
check to see if any of the selected polys is an actual useful poly (not
just a thin line and not just bleeding through another polygon). Exclude
any such polys from your selection by holding down the Alt key and clicking
the poly. Once the only polys that are selected are the useless buried
ones, press the delete key, answer "Yes" when asked to delete selected
verts, and answer "Yes" when asked to delete any isolated verts. Repeat
the procedure for the rest of your model until you get rid of all unwanted
polygons.

remove hidden and unwanted polygons from a section of your mesh, it's a
good idea to isolate it first as described above.

the 3D view to Flat Shaded and turn off Draw Backfaces. Go into Face Mode
and select all visible polygons of the section. It helps to change frames
to get to polys which are only visible in certain frames.

the selected polygons. If any polys are still visible, they are probably
undesirable polys which are completely useless.

order to verify that the polys still visible are actually wasted polys,
select them all by drawing a box around them. Unhide all polys, and make
sure none of the selected polys are visible on any frame.

within other others, delete them.
