<br><u><font color="#00FF80"><font size=+2>Step 1: Mesh and Bones</font></font></u></center>

<p>> The first thing you need to do is build your mesh in Animation: Master.
I would assume you're at least proficient in the program, but I will give
you a few tips to help you along...
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>BASIC TIPS</b></center>

<p>> As any A:M user knows, a patch can consist of three or four connected
splines. However, a Quake2 model can only consist of three sided polygons.
Whenever an A:M model is converted into a polygon based one, it's patch
count will translate into a higher number of polygons. Since a four-sided
patch will be split into two polygons, the more four sided patches your
model has, the greater the increase of patches to polys. If all of the
patches in your model are four sided ones (which is usually not the case),
your patch count will simply be doubled into polygons.

<p>> Whenever modeling a mesh that will eventually be converted into a
Quake2 model, (or any other format that uses only peeked splines), it's
generally a good idea to build it with peeked splines. Sometimes, it's
useful to use a curved spline, especially when tracing a line from a rotoscope.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<center>
<p><b>ROTOSCOPES</b></center>

<p>> Whenever you build a complex model, it's a good idea to apply rotoscopes
as references to whatever you're attempting to model. If you're modelling
a commercial cartoon character, the best rotoscopes will usually be the
character's official turnaround model sheet. Such an image can be found
on the Internet, or from the official artwork book of whatever show or
movie the character is from (The Making of...). If you can't find any such
official model sheet, you can improvise by capturing screenshots of the
character, and use those as your rotoscope. (Of course, you need access
to a video adapter card or a TV tuner to take screenshots.) This method
can be tricky, because it's not always easy to tell if an angle is exactly
the front, profile, or whatever angle you're trying to capture. Even if
the character is facing the right direction, a slight tilt can throw you
off when used as a rotoscope. So take several shots of each desired angle,
taking your best guess as to what the exact front view, profile, and back
view should look like. As a guide, you can use a turnaround model sheet
of another character to choose the best screenshots. When applying the
rotoscopes, make sure all the angles are consistant with each other. (The
nose on one rotoscope has to be consistent with the nose on the others,
and so must every other part of the character.)
<p>> The ideal rotoscopes you can use for modelling a character in 3D are
full body shots of the exact front, side, back, angles. Sometimes, it may
be helpful to use a top view of the character, but such an angle is usually
not included in an offical model sheet, and is by far the most difficult
find a screenshot of. It's not always possible to find a screenshot of
turnaround model sheet quality (with the character standing upright, with
his/her hands to the side, with both legs straight, shot at the exact angle
desired, and with none of the body cropped out of the shot), but there's
a way to get around this issue. Here's what I do whan I run into this problem.
I take screenshots of the head, torso, and legs, and apply them as separate
rotoscopes. First, I apply the head screenshots as rotoscopes to their
appropriate angles, then build the head portion of the model. Next, I delete
the head rotoscopes, then apply those of the torso, then build the model's
torso. Finally, I follow suit with the legs.

<p><b>MISSING PATCHES</b></center>

<p>> If there is a hole where there should logically be a patch, delete
a spline of the missing patch. Use the Add Lock feature to create separate
a spline with four control points. Attach the second control point of this
line to a CP of the spline you deleted, and the third to the other deleted
CP. This should cause the patch to appear properly. You can now delete
the first and fourth CP of your new spline. I have Strykerwolf at Polycount
to thank for this method.

<p><b>CREASE REDUCTION</b></center>

<p>> A major ass itch that 3D animators must face is abnormal creasing
in their models while animating them. Fortunately, Animation: Master 99
and all versions following it have a feature called SmartSkin. SmartSkin
allows you to assign control points to particular locations depending on
the rotation of certain bones. Here's how it works...
<p>> During the building of your mesh, make sure you build its joints a
certain way in order for it&nbsp; to take advantage of SmartSkin.
<p><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/SS_Elbow.gif"><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/SS_Elbow.gif" NOSAVE height=100 width=100></a>Your
model's elbows should each consist of two unconnected rings of splines...

<p><font color="#FF8080">> After applying a skeleton to your model, apply
a SmartSkin to one of your model's bones. Select a bone, right-click it,
and select 'New SmartSkin'. After selecting an axis in which to apply the
SmartSkin on, a new window will open, in which your selected bone will
be bent at a 90 degree angle. In this window, you can manipulate control
points to suit the angle of the bone with a minimum amount of creasing.
After the SmartSkin is applied, it will take effect in all of the model's
animations. Here is a list of the bones and angles I use the SmartSkin
feature on...</font>

<p>> In order to make your model's wrist twist properly while your model's
hands twist, it's a good idea to rotate each ring of splines down the arm
all the way to the shoulder. (This belongs to the Z-Axis of the hands.)
This should be done gradually up the arm. It may take you about an hour
to find the right rotations for each ring of the arm, but patience can
pay off big time.
