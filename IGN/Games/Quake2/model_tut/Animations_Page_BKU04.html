<br><u><font color="#00FF80"><font size=+2>Step 2: Animations</font></font></u></center>

<p>> After your model's mesh is completed, and the bones are correctly
applied, the next step is to animate the model for use in the game. A fully
animated Quake2 plugin player model has 20 different animations. Each of
the model's animations should be created in it's own Action, and have the
correct number of frames. Once all 20 animations are completed, you can
then complile them in a single choreography.
<center>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>FRAMES LIST</b></center>

<p>> A Quake2 plugin player model consists of 20 individual animations
which have a total of exactly 198 frames. Each animation has its own number
of frames, ranging from 4 to 40. Some of the animations loop, so that they
look like a continuous and unbroken animation when played repeatedly. When
animating a PPM, it is mandatory that each animation consists of the correct
number of frames, and loops where appropriate. In order to help you along,
you can follow the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/resources/quake2/q2frameslist.shtml" target="_top">Frames
List</a></font> on Polycount. If you for some reson you can't access the
list, or have trouble following it, you can use my version of the list
below...

<td><font color="#33FF33">40</font></td>

<td><font color="#33FF33">The Stand animation is the one that is most likely
going to be seen more than any other animation, and therefore must be of
especially high quality. At 40 frames, it is by far the longest of the
animations, taking up over a fifth of the PPM's total frames. A character
going through the Stand is most likely to be looking around. However, the
animation can also be in the form of a fighting stance, or whatever else
you can think of. You can be very creative with Stand by adding a few extras,
such as having your character cock the gun, crack his/her knuckles, or
scratch his/her head, but don't go for anything too flashy. Since Stand
is very commonly seen, it can get old quickly, and I recommend that you
save the true pizzaz for the less common animations. Stand is one of the
four looping animations, which means its final frames should show the character
smoothly returning to his/her state in the first frame.</font></td>

<td><font color="#33FF33">6</font></td>

<td><font color="#33FF33">Another looping animation, the Run plays while
the character moves about the arena of death. The Run is a six frame animation
that typically involves the first three frames dealing with one leg hitting
the ground, while the other three frames are a mirror image of the first
three. While making this animation, it's important to avoid "skating",
or when your model's feet slide unnaturally along the floor when they're
supposed to be planted in one place. After I finish the run animation for
my models, I go to both the left or right view and the front or back view
of my model, and zoom in on the planted foot in both views. I then run
the animation one frame at a time, and adjust the foot so that it's on
the ground in each frame. I then of course repeat the process with the
other foot.</font></td>

fires his/her weapon. The weapon is discharged during the first frame of
the Attack animation. I would recommend having the PPM in full recoil in
the first frame, and then spend the rest of Attack recovering (returning
to the first frame of Stand). Or, you could also put the recoil in the
first frame, then have your character cock the gun quickly before returning
to the first frame of Stand.</font></td>

The third frame of Jump is your standard airborne frame and will hold until
the PPM lands. If the PPM falls far enough to take damage, a random Pain

<p><b>LOOPING</b></center>

<p>> Aa any proficient animatior knows, looping is when an animation runs
over and over again, A successful looping animation has its last frames
blend smoothly into its first frame, so you can't tell exactly where the
animation begins and ends. The Stand, Run, Crouch Stand, and Crouch Walk
animations all loop. In order to create an animation that loops smoothly,
simply follow these steps...

<p><b>DUAL PURPOSE ANIMATIONS</b></center>

<p>> The Grenade Toss and Change Weapon animations are not officially included
in the frames list. Instead, the grenade toss is Wave played backwards,
while Change Weapon is Pain3 played backwards. If you want to create your
PPM to specifically take advantage of the Genade Toss animation, simply
create an Action for GT, animate it as usual (making sure GT has exactly
17 frames, of course), then reverse the keyframes, so that the animation
runs backwards. Here's my method of reversing the frames in an animation...
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>After
completing the Grenade Toss animation, create a new Action, and position
its window next to one of the windows of your Grenade Toss animation.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>While
in Key Model Mode&nbsp;<img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/KMM.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=24 width=24>,
copy the last keyframe of the Grenade Toss. Paste it onto the new action's
first frame.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Count
the number of steps between the last and second-to-last keyframe of the
Grenade Toss. (The number of steps will be the number of frames between
two keyframes, plus one. This is the number of frames you need to advance
to get from one frame to another. For example, two back-to-back keyframes
will have one step between them, and keyframes which are seven frames apart
will have eight steps between them.) Copy the second-to-last keyframe.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Add
the number of steps between the last and second-to-last keyframe of the
Grenade Toss to the number of the current keyframe in the new action, which
in this case will be 1. Enter the sum in the frame number text box. For
example, if there are four steps between the last and second-to-last keyframe
of the Grenade Toss, and the last keyframe you pasted in the new animation
was 5, 4 + 5 = 9, so you would enter "9" in the frame number text box.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Paste
the keyframe to the new frame of the new action.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Count
the number of steps between the second-to-last and third-to-last keyframe
of the Grenade Toss. Copy the third-to-last keyframe.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Add
the number of steps between the second-to-last and third-to-last keyframe
of the Grenade Toss to the number of the current keyframe in the new action.
Enter the sum in the frame number text box, then paste the keyframe to
the new frame of the new action. Repeat until the new animation is a reversed
version of the Grenade Toss. If the new animation has exactly 17 frames,
then you've done everything right.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p><b>COLLECTIVE CHOREOGRAPHY</b></center>

<p>> Once all 20 of your PPM's animations are finished, the next step is
to compile them into a single choreography.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Start
a new choreography.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Apply
your model to the choreography. In the project workspace drag your model
to the newly created choreography.
<p><img SRC="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Model_Tut/INYA.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=100 width=100>Import
your PPMs Actions to the PPM in the choreography one by one. You must inport
the Acions in the exact order of the frames table. (First Stand, then Run,
then Attack, etc.) If you've imported all of the Actions and realise that
one or more is out of order, you can correct this by draging the out-of-place
Actions in their correct positions.
<p>> Check the choreography to see if it has exactly 198 frames from the
first frame of Stand, to the last frame of Death3. If there are more than
198 frames, either some of your Actions have extra frames, or you accidentally
imported an Action twice. If there less than 198 frames, some of your Actions
may have too few frames, or you may have forgotten to include an Action
or two in your choreography. And of course, remember to save your choreography.
