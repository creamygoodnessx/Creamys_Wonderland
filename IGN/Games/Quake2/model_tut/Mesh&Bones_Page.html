<p><b><font face="SpaceOne">BASIC TIPS</font></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; As any <a href="http://www.hash.com/" target="_top">A:M</a> user knows, a patch can
consist of
three or four connected splines. However, a <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake2</a>
model can only
consist
of three sided polygons. Whenever an A:M model is converted into a
polygon
based one, it's patch count will translate into a higher number of
polygons.
Since a four-sided patch will be split into two polygons, the more four
sided patches your model has, the greater the increase of patches to
polys.
If all of the patches in your model are four sided ones (which is
usually
not the case), your patch count will simply be doubled into polygons.</font>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Whenever modeling a mesh that will
eventually
be converted into a Quake2 model, (or any other format that uses only
peeked
splines), it's generally a good idea to build it with peeked splines.
Sometimes,
it's useful to use a curved spline, especially when tracing a line from
a rotoscope.</font></p>
<hr width="100%">
<center>
<p><b><font face="SpaceOne">ROTOSCOPES</font></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Whenever you build a complex model, it's
a good
idea to apply rotoscopes as references to whatever you're attempting to
model. If you're modelling a commercial cartoon character, the best
rotoscopes
will usually be the character's official turnaround model sheet. Such
an
image can be found on the Internet, or from the official artwork book
of
whatever show or movie the character is from (The Making of...). If you
can't find any such official model sheet, you can improvise by
capturing
screenshots of the character, and use those as your rotoscope. (Of
course,
you need access to a video adapter card or a TV tuner to take
screenshots.)
This method can be tricky, because it's not always easy to tell if an
angle
is exactly the front, profile, or whatever angle you're trying to
capture.
Even if the character is facing the right direction, a slight tilt can
throw you off when used as a rotoscope. So take several shots of each
desired
angle, taking your best guess as to what the exact front view, profile,
and back view should look like. As a guide, you can use a turnaround
model
sheet of another character to choose the best screenshots. When
applying
the rotoscopes, make sure all the angles are consistant with each
other.
(The nose on one rotoscope has to be consistent with the nose on the
others,
and so must every other part of the character.)</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; The ideal rotoscopes you can use for
modelling
a character in 3D are full body shots of the exact front, side, back,
angles.
Sometimes, it may be helpful to use a top view of the character, but
such
an angle is usually not included in an offical model sheet, and is by
far
the most difficult find a screenshot of. It's not always possible to
find
a screenshot of turnaround model sheet quality (with the character
standing
upright, with his/her hands to the side, with both legs straight, shot
at the exact angle desired, and with none of the body cropped out of
the
shot), but there's a way to get around this issue. Here's what I do
whan
I run into this problem. I take screenshots of the head, torso, and
legs,
and apply them as separate rotoscopes. First, I apply the head
screenshots
as rotoscopes to their appropriate angles, then build the head portion
of the model. Next, I delete the head rotoscopes, then apply those of
the
torso, then build the model's torso. Finally, I follow suit with the
legs.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="SpaceOne">MISSING PATCHES</font></b></p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; If there is a hole where there should
logically
be a patch, delete a spline of the missing patch. Use the Add Lock&nbsp;<img src="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/AddLock.gif" nosave="" style="border: 0px solid ; height: 32px; width: 32px;" title="" alt="">

the
second control point of this line to a CP of the spline you deleted,

the third to the other deleted CP. This should cause the patch to

spline.

<p><b><font face="SpaceOne">EASY EYELIDS</font></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; The SmartSkin can be used to conveniently
animate
certain parts of a model where the conventional use of bones isn't
practical.
For example, a model's eyelids can be fitted with a SmartSkin so that
they
can open and close with the simple movement of a bone. In order to make
this work, a bone must be created for each eyelid. These "eye bones"
should
be detached from the rest of the model's skeleton.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Create a new SmartSkin for the Z-axis of
one
of the eyelid bones, and set the axis to 0 degrees. Rotate and
translate
the eyelid to cover the eye completely, so that the eye looks like its
closed all the way. (Whenever I first model the eyelids, they are in
closed
position by default. So applying their SmartSkin is just a matter of
creating
a new keyframe instead of manipulating the control points. Sometimes, I
select the eyelid, then press the up key once, then the down key once
just
to make sure the keyframe is created.) Then set the bone's Z-axis to
179
degrees, and manipulate the control points of the eyelid so that the
lid
is turned upward just above the eye, and buried completely inside the
head.
If the SmartSkin is applied correctly, turning the Z-axis during one of
the model's animations should cause the eyelid to open and close; the
lower
the number of the Z-axis, the more closed the eye will be, the higher
the
number, the more open. If you notice any irregular movement of the
eyelid,
it can probably be fixed by setting a half-open value on its Z-axis at
90 degrees. Of course, you will have to repeat the entire process on
the
other eyelid.</font>

mod</font>el, I used a different method for the eyelid SmartSkins than
my other models. In the case of most of my models, the eyes are part of
the model's skin, and the eyelid moves to cover and uncover it. I find
it easiest to initially model the eyelids in the closed position,
because
this position needs to be modelled more accurately than the open
position.
(When closed, the eyelid needs to be the right size and shape to cover
the eyes completely, and be only as big as it needs to be. When open,
the
eyelid will be hidden inside the head, and doesn't have to be as
accurate
as when it's closed.) However, in the case of the Dib model, I
initially
modelled the eyes in the open position. Dib has no eyelids, but
instead,
the eye itself is a separate part of the face which changes shape based
on how open or closed it is. Each eye also includes a 6 patch segment
that
shows the eye in its fully closed position, and this segment is buried
within the head until needed.</font>

the keyframes of the SmartSkin are completed, I straightened all of its

Edit Channels&nbsp;<img src="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Edit_Channels.gif" nosave="" style="height: 24px; width: 24px;" title="" alt="">.
I selected all of the control points in the Channels window, and in the
Group window, I clicked on the Linear option button.</font>
