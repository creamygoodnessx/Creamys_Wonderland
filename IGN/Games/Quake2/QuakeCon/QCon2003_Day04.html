2003
- Day Four</font></font></font></p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Around 1AM, an announcer on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/The_Knock.jpg">the
noc</a> said that we only had 12 hours left before the network was
dismantled,
and made a joke about this being our last chance to download porn.
Somehow,
this led to a contest to see who could have the most porn on their
system
by 2AM. One person had a whopping 197GB of porn on his machine! Soon
after
the contest started, it was abruptly canceled. I personally think the
whole
thing was a joke from the start. A few hours later, a video clip was
being
played on the big screen to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/Knock_Right.jpg">the
right</a> of the noc. It was a clip of the original 8-bit <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super
Mario Brothers</a> game, and the player was doing all sorts of crazy
things
that normally can't be done in the game. In the clip, Mario could swim
through spinning rods of fire unharmed, send Koopa Troopas into the
ground,
and apparently climb on the sides of walls to save himself from falling
into pits.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; I think it was around 4 or 5AM when the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
people treated us to a round of funny movie clips. I had copies of the
shown movies already, but this didn't diminish the fun I had watching
them.
The clips they showed that I didn't have included a cat hanging onto a
blade of a spinning ceiling fan, one that showed a group of German
factory
workers, and a clip of an insanely good Japanese Tetris player. After a
few clips, the attendees were allowed to upload their own movies. I
decided
to upload a few good movies in my collection, and two of them were
played;
Black White Supremacist, and The Parlor, both of which the crowd
enjoyed.
However not all the files that were uploaded were welcome. Evidently,
some
fucking asshole found it necessary to upload 3 viruses onto the server.
The guy running the server, communicating to the crowd through WordPad,
let us know that he didn't approve of this malicious act. After the
movies
were finished, I went back to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/Glamdring02.jpg">Glamdring</a>
and downloaded some of the movies
I liked, but didn't have yet.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; After taking a short break to shower,
brush
teeth, and get about an hour of sleep, I left my room for the final
time
and checked out of the hotel just before noon. My <a href="http://www.shuttlebus-zoom.com/" target="_top">ShuttleBus</a>
was to arrive at 1:30PM, so I figured I'd go back to Glamdring and do
some
last minute downloading. Since I couldn't get any free T-shirts during
my trip, I decided to buy two shirts they were selling in the BYOC room
for $20 for two shirts. When I got to my computer, it was out of power,
because the power strip it was plugged into was gone, and the machine
had
run out of power by the time I got to it. So I plugged Glamdring into
another
strip, hoping to charge the battery enough so I could use the machine
on
the plane. Just then, I heard an announcement over the loudspeaker that
more volunteers were needed to dismantle the network. Since I hadn't
yet
volunteered for the event, I went up to the noc and offered my
assistance.
In a little over an hour, I collected a bunch of Ethernet cables, some
<a href="http://www.linksys.com/" target="_top">LinkSys</a>
boxes, and 192 bottles of Bawls. Just before 1:30PM, I packed up
Glamdring
and all my other belongings, when I noticed that someone AGAIN plugged
out my machine. I figured it wasn't going to be that much of a big
deal,
since I could probably plug in at the airport anyway, and have time to
charge the battery before the flight arrived.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; A little after 1:30PM, I hopped aboard
the ShuttleBus,
and was on my to <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas
Fort Worth</a>. I wasn't the only QuakeCon attendee on the bus, though.
The creators of <a href="http://www.punkbuster.com/index.php" target="_top">PunkBuster</a>
were also on their was to the airport, and I talked to them for a while
about their program. When I arrived at the airport, I soon discovered,
to my horror, that I forgot the yellow envelope containing my e-ticket
home to Jersey, and my passport. Mercifully, I was able to get a new
e-ticket
for free by running my ATM card through a certain machine. Just before
I was to go through the metal detector, the security guy noticed my
Swiss
Army Knife on my keychain, and said I'd have to check it. My problem
was that my luggage bag was already on its way to the plane, so my only
hope of keeping my knife was to give it to the guy who checks the
tickets,
and hope he can locate my bag before it got to the plane. He apparently
failed, because I never saw my knife again. They wouldn't let my take
my
knife on the plane, but for some reason, I don't feel any safer
whenever
I go to the airport. Wonder why. Anyways, I found an outlet to charge
Glamdring's
battery while I played some FreeCell, and I got it up to 94% before I
had
to pack up and board my flight home.</font></p>
