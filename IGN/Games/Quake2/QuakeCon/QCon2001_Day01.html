<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; My plane arrived at <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">DFW</a>
about half an hour earlier than expected. The previous night, I had
received
my new <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=1&amp;catalogId=-840&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=2035724" target="_top">IBM
ThinkPad</a>, and spent all night installing software on it. I was also
stuck with packing for the trip, and preparing for the head modeling
contest
that never came to be, so I ended up getting no sleep at all that
night.
I couldn't get any sleep on the plane either due to lack of comfort,
but
somehow I wasn't tired when we got to the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>.
When standing in line for the registration for the BYOC, I met HarlequiN
for a brief moment, and had for lunch a 2 dollar slice of pizza. When I
finally got into the event, I was greeted with the sight of literally
hundreds
of machines, some of them with homemade chassis. (My favorites being
the
one with the round window with the green neon rim, and the black one
with
the blue christmas tree lights.) I set up my ThinkPad, which I'd named
Glamdring, on the seventh table from the rear wall near the Men's room.
I was frustrated by the fact that <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/" target="_top">Q3A</a>
was running really slowly, and by the jumpiness of my mouse. I also had
lost the sheet that told me the IP settings I needed to connect to the
BYOC network, so I had to call my parents from their hotel room and ask
me to send me back my passport, so I could get another IP address. When
I finally got myself online with a bit of help from the QCon staff, I
downloaded
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_top">WinZip</a>
and the latest version of Q3A, the latter seemed to solve both of the
problems
I was having with the game. But then, just as I thought my worries were
over, the QCon's generator overheated, resulting in a blackout. The
unmistakable
sound of the power-down filled the room as the machines all around me
shut
down. But there were survivors. The first seven rows in the front of
the
room were unaffected, while everything else suffered. I was in the back
of the room, but because of my fully powered Li-Ion battery, Glamdring
remained operational, while those around me fell. And if one blackout
wasn't
enough, we had three more before the day was through. That night, I met
<a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycount</a>
guys on balcony by the pool. This had to be the highlight of the day;
meeting
the people of the community that I'd been a part of for the past two
years
in person for the first time. As far as I remember, I met Phuky, TNSLB,
rogue13,
Wrath, Goatman,
HarlequiN, and bearkub. As far as my dinner went, my parents were kind
enough to stop by with some chicken and fries, but in my excitement
over
the Q3A match I was in, I only managed to finish about three quarters
of
my food. Before the night was through, I talked to the Quake
Generations
mod team, and was amazed by the amount of work they put into their mod.
They mentioned an early attempt at their mod being stalled by legal
issues,
but I can't remember the details. Goatman and I returned to our room
(211)
at the <a href="http://www.comfortinn.com/" target="_top">Comfort Inn</a>
late that night, maybe around 2 or 3 in the morning, where he gave me a
sneak preview of Big Guy and Rusty model.</font></p>
