<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; We woke up the next morning around 9 or
9:30.
I visited my parents room (204) to see how they were doing. Before
heading
back to the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QCon</a>,
Goatman
and I enjoyed a quick breakfast at <a href="http://www.comfortinn.com/" target="_top">Comfort</a>,
then went shopping in town. I got myself a couple of two liters of
Pepsi
and some candy, and when we arrived at the QCon, we parted ways. I
managed
to get a few downloads started when the people at the podium requested
volunteers for something. So I figured, 'what the hell, if these guys
are
offering us this free event, why not give back something in return.' I
went up to the podium to see what they needed, and they asked me to
watch
a door, to make sure that no unauthorized people went through, until a
cop showed up. While I was standing there, my parents arrived and
offered
to take me to a <a href="http://www.mesquiterodeo.com/" target="_top">rodeo</a>
later that night. I accepted their offer, even though rodeos aren't my
thing. When I was finally relieved from the guard position, Nash from
the
QCon staff upgraded my name tag from 'General' to 'Staff'. Later on in
the day, I helped to check configs at the tournament. Right after I
finished,
I met up with Hunter and spoke with him for a couple of minutes before
heading back to Glamdring to try out the Generations mod. Later that
night,
I went to my first rodeo, and while I felt like I was in some kind of
alien
world and even uncomfortable at times, I never regretted going.
Conveniently,
the rodeo was located next door to the QCon. When I returned to my
laptop,
I tried to get onto a particular Generations server, but Glamdring
spent
over an hour downloading maps, so I didn't get to play too much of it.
Of course, I managed to sneak in some <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake2/" target="_top">Quake2</a>,
as I had noticed the two people on my right were playing it. It was a
lot
of fun, as my two opponents were <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QCon2001_Q2_TT.dm2">only
slightly stronger than me</a>. Like the
previous night, Goatman and I returned to the Comfort Inn late.</font></p>
