<span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; My </span><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> experience this
year had its share of problems, and most of them occurred before I even
got to the event. I was supposed to take a flight from Philadelphia
that would have gotten me to <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a> sometime after 10AM
Texas time, but because I didn't arrive at the airport early enough, I
was forced to take the next flight which was scheduled to arrive around
1PM. When I finally got to Dallas, I went to the baggage claim to pick
up the ice maker box which contained <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Builds/CES_Log_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a>, its UPS, illuminated keyboard,
green <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-copperhead/" target="_top">Razer Copperhead mouse</a>, socks and underwear. But
after a few
minutes of waiting for the box to appear, the carrousel suddenly
stopped, so I thought to myself, "OK, no big deal, the carrousel will
start again in a few minutes, I'll pick up my box and be on my merry
way". However, after around ten minutes of the machine remaining still
with my ice maker box nowhere in sight, I started to panic. It was
around then when someone mentioned that we should go to a nearby
customer service desk for help, so that's what I did. After a short
wait in line, I explained my situation to a lady who had a gimpy right
arm, and she gave me an important sheet of paper and told me that the
box
would be sent to the hotel later that day. I was soon on a ShuttleBus
that brought me to the <a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a> where the QuakeCon was being held.<br>
<br>
&gt; Just before 3:30PM, I arrived at the hotel and registered for the
QuakeCon's BYOC right away. On the way to the registration area, I met
Bronco from the <a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycount</a> community,
and talked to him for a bit. When
I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2006/Registration_Line.avi" style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);">got to the registration table</a>,
I had planned on registering CES and
the rest of my setup, but because most of my stuff was still caught up
at the airport, this obviously wasn't an option. However, I was allowed
to register my monitor, since I had brought that as a carry-on item on
the plane. I was told that I could register everything else once they
got to the hotel.<br>
<br>
&gt; When I got into the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/BYOC01.jpg">ballroom</a>
where the BYOC was being held, I met
Bronco again, and this time he was with Frankie, another member of
Polycount. After saying hello and snapping <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Frankie&amp;Bronco.jpg">this
picture</a> of the two, I
looked around the BYOC room and saw a lot of custom case mods that some
attendees had brought with them. One person had brought a large
transparent cube that had red and white lights inside of it, while
another case was build from an old vinyl <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Record_Player.jpg">record
player</a> with bright
purple lights. I picked out a table that was on the left-most row of
the room, and setup my <a href="http://www.benq.com/" target="_top">BenQ</a>
17" flat screen monitor. <br>
<br>
&gt; As I was checking into the hotel at the front desk, I asked the
lady behind the counter to be on the lookout for the ice maker box. She
said that the front desk would not receive the box, but referred me to
the business center, who referred me to another desk, who then referred
me to the bell stand. After I explained my situation to them and gave
them a description of the box, the people there took down my name, cell
phone number, and room number (7187), and said that they would call me
when the box arrived. At around 4:30PM, I finally entered <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Room_7187.jpg">my
hotel room</a>
for the first time. The room had two large beds, a bathroom with a door
that didn't lock, and a decent view of downtown Dallas, and because my
Uncle Jim and two of my cousins couldn't make the trip with me, I had
the room all to myself.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime that evening, I called the 1-800 number that was on the
important sheet the woman at the airport had given me in order to check
the status of CES's delivery to the hotel. After going through a fully
automated process in which I had to give out the package's file locator
number which was printed on the form, I was basically told that the
package could not be found. So I called up my mother and explained the
call I had just made to the <a href="http://www.usairways.com/awa/default.aspx" target="_top">US
Airways</a>, and she was just as upset as I was
about the situation. She wanted to call the airline herself to see if
she could be little more persuasive in getting CES to the Hilton, so I
gave her the numbers on the airline's phone number and file locator
number. Now that I'd done everything that I could to bring my machine
to the event, I decided to return to the BYOC room to take another look
around, take some pictures, and hopefully get some free stuff. A little
while later, while still in the BYOC room, my mother called me back and
said that she had managed to talk to a live person who told her that my
box should arrive at the hotel in about an hour. But when that hour had
passed, CES still didn't get to the hotel. <br>
<br>
&gt; I would talk to my mother at least two more times that evening,
and each time she would say that according to US Air, the box was still
in Philly. But when I heard from her again around 8PM, she said that
the box was in Dallas and would arrive around 9PM. With nothing else to
do, I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a 2 liter bottle of Coke from <a href="http://www.dominos.com/Public-EN/" target="_top">Domino's Pizza</a>
and had
a couple slices around 8:30PM. This pizza would last me the entire
event, and I had to finish it before checking out on the final day, or
I would be forced to throw whatever was left of it away. At 9PM, I went
to the bell stand and asked the guy there if the box had arrived, but
unfortunately it hadn't. However, he also said that the airlines make
runs through different hotels, delivering wayward luggage to each of
them in turn, and the box should arrive around 1AM. So with nothing to
do, I decided to go up to my room and get some sleep, since I probably
wouldn't get too many opportunities to do so later on. <br>
<br>
&gt; I was awakened by the room's phone around 11PM, and it was the
bell stand telling me that the CES's box had finally arrived, so I
scrambled to get some clothes on, and then went down to pick it up. The
box weighed 40 pounds, and so I wasn't too thrilled about carrying it
all the way across the main building, to the building where the BYOC
room was, and to CES's future table. So I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/CES_Box_On_Dolly.jpg">borrowed
a dolly</a> from the
bell stand, and used that wheel it to the registration table.
Apparently, something I did caught the attention of some cops who were
standing at the entrance of the ballroom. They said that my eyes were
dilated and that I was acting all hyper, and they seemed to think that
I was on drugs or some shit. My keychain had a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Swiss_Army_Knife_Saphire.jpg">Swiss Army Knife</a> on it,
and in order to keep it from getting taken away, I brought it to my
hotel room and returned to registration. I was given a sheet that
contained descriptions of CES and its peripherals, and I would need it
to bring my things out of the BYOC room. After getting to my table, I
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/CES_Setup%28Dark%29.jpg">set
up CES</a> and started up the system just before midnight. CES
connected to the network right away without me having to change any IP
settings, and I was soon officially part of the BYOC.</span>
