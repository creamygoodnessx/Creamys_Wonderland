2003
- Day One</font></font></font></p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; On the 14th of August 2003 (a Thursday),
I arrived
at <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas
Fort
Worth</a> at around 4:00PM Dallas time. I took a <a href="http://www.shuttlebus-zoom.com/" target="_top">ShuttleBus</a>
to the <a href="http://www.adamsmark.com/adamsmark/index.html" target="_top">Adam's
Mark Hotel</a>, where the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
was being held. I carried all three of my bags (my backpack, laptop
bag,
and luggage bag) to the second floor, where the BYOC (bring your own
own
computer) was taking place. While I was signing up, the young lady
checking
my bags noticed my Pull N Peel Twizzlers, and didn't let me take them
into
the BYOC room. That seemed odd to me, since food was allowed during the
event two years earlier. When I asked someone at the event why that
was,
he said that the hotel didn't want food in the room, because it could
mess
up the carpet, while QCon 2001 was held in a room that had a concrete
floor.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; The registration folks gave me a sheet of
paper
they told me not to lose. Not only did it have information I needed to
get on the network (IP address settings), I also wouldn't be allowed to
take my computer out of the room without it. I left my luggage bag and
Twizzlers by the registration tables, took my other two bags into the
BYOC
room, and settled down at the seventh row from the back of the room,
like
I did in 2001. The table was apparently reserved for a clan, but since
they hadn't shown up yet, the guy next to me suggested that I take the
slot for myself, so I did. After putting my bags down on the table, I
walked
around the room and checked out the different computers people had
brought
with them, some built from scratch. I recognized some computers from
last
year, but I did see some new ones as well. I went back to my table,
grabbed
my <a href="http://www.epinions.com/reviews/pr-Veo_Capture_1300_Digital_Camera" target="_top">digital camera</a>, and took a few pictures of the machines...</font>

</center>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; When I returned to my table, I got to
work on
setting up </font><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/Glamdring01.jpg">Glamdring</a></font><font face="SpaceOne"> (my <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=1&amp;catalogId=-840&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=2035724" target="_top">IBM
ThinkPad</a>), but I couldn't find an Ethernet cable to hook up my
machine
to the network. So I went up to the big podium at the front of the
room,
which they called <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/The_Knock.jpg">"the
Noc"</a>, and asked for a cable. They didn't have any left, but they
told me to wait 20 minutes for new ones to be crimped. This was only
the
start of the network problems I'd be having throughout the day. I
eventually
found an unused Ethernet about 15 feet to the right of me(how the hell
did I miss that?), and spent about an hour searching the area around
Glamdring
for a port to get myself onto the network, but as far as I could see,
they
were all being used. Then, I realized that the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/" target="_top">LinkSys</a>
Boxes had 16 ports each, and not 8 as I thought, and plugged
Glamdring's
cable into a nearby port. (On all the boxes I saw, all of the ports on
the top row had a plug in them, covering up the bottom row.) Then using
my network sheet, I went into my network settings and set them
according
to the sheet. I had a few false starts, but even after I was sure I set
everything correctly, I still couldn't connect to the network. Two of
the
QuakeCon attendees who knew a lot about networking (or at least more
than
I did), were kind enough to help me, but even they were stumped.
Omitting
any further details, I made a few more attempts to get on the network
throughout
the night, but just didn't have any luck. :( One thing I didn't need
the
network for was playing <a href="http://hylianhd.rpgplanet.gamespy.com/z_5.php" target="_top">Ocarina
of Time</a> on <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/UltraHLE/" target="_top">UltraHLE</a>,
my Nintendo 64 emulator of choice. As I was playing, I did manage to
turn
a few heads, which felt pretty good. :)</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Sometime that evening, I heard that there
were
still openings for the <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/" target="_top">Quake3</a>
1v1 tournament, so I rushed to the room where the contest was to be
held
and signed up for it. Even though I had missed the registration for the
tourney when I registered for the QuakeCon a few months earlier, I was
still going to compete, and I was just ecstatic. I had to back to my
luggage
bag to get my keyboard, which was just a regular PS/2, no frills
keyboard
I got for free as part of my <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/a/" target="_top">A+
Certification</a> training class nearly a
year
earlier. I was going to use it for my brand new PS/2 to USB adapter I
bought
at <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/" target="_top">Radio Shack</a>
back
in Jersey. But just after 6PM, before I got a chance to use the
adapter,
someone came up to my table and noticed it plugged into my keyboard,
and
asked to buy it off me for $20. He said he needed it for one of the
contests
he was going to compete in. After thinking about it for a while, I
reluctantly
sold it to him for $19, but wasn't too bummed, since I originally got
it
for about $14. I eventually checked into the hotel, and was given the
keycard
for Room 604. I then took my luggage bag and Twizzlers off the hands of
the registration people, and brought them up to my room.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Just before 9PM that day, I began to
wonder
why my name wasn't being called to announce my turn at the tournament.
So I went back to the Quake3 tourney room to find out what the hell was
going on. To my horror, my turn to play occurred half an hour earlier,
and there was no way I could be rescheduled. It turns out that I was
told
what time I was going to play when I signed up, and they were not going
to announce it in the BYOC room as I'd thought. As you can imagine, I
was
extremely upset about missing out on the tournament, so I marched back
to my table and decided to play on a little Quake over the network, so
I could get my mind off of my disappointment. I soon remembered that I
couldn't get on the network, so I then decided to play some more Zelda.
Everything else is going wrong, but at least I have Zelda to show off,
right? Wrong. I clicked on my Desktop shortcut to UltraHLE and noticed
the path was missing. So I decided to go into the emulator's directory
and open it directly, but I soon discovered my ENTIRE Emulators folder
tree was GONE. Then I realized that I'd forgotten to switch to
read-only
access to my C drive, and some fucking prick must have taken advantage
and deleted my directory. For me, that was the last straw and I just
lost
it. So I called my mother in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>
and begged her to pick me up the following day and get me the fuck out
of there, and if there was no way to take me back to New Jersey, I told
her to find a way. But she said my return trip was already booked for
Sunday,
and then she mentioned something about some big blackout in Jersey or
something.
She basically said I was stuck there, and I'd have to make the best of
things.</font></p>
