<span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; Sometime before 1AM, I went back to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/TastySpleen.jpg">TastySpleen table</a> to see if I could give away some of my extra cans of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"><a href="http://www.bawls.com/" target="_top">Bawls</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">, but <a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/btfdeathstalker/" target="_top">DeathStlkr</a> and <a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/jitspoe/" target="_top">Jitspoe</a> still hadn't shown up. At that time, Fanny was packing up to leave, but before he left, he took <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Non-CGX/Qcon2k8-057.jpg">this group picture</a>
of me with JDolan, Webhead, and Jitspoe. I offered Fanny some of my
extra Bawls, but he said he already had three cases. The rest of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"><a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
also had an over abundance of Bawls, so I ended up giving six cans away
to the general QuakeCon attendees by setting them at the end of the
Information Desk. After 1PM, DeathStlkr said he was about to set up a
server. When that server eventually went up, I tried to connect to it,
but I was unable to download the map. Just after 3AM, I had a chance to
play one last game of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> against the TastySpleen guys. We only played <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QuakeCon2008_-_Q2_-_004.dm2">one game</a>
in the Research Lab, but it was fun nevertheless, and I happened to get
in a second place finish with 14 frags when Spike hit the 20 frag limit.<br><br>&gt; Sometime around four, I was leaving the BYOC room when I saw that <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/capcomvssnk2markoftm/index.html" target="_top">Capcom Vs. SNK 2</a>
was being projected on a nearby small screen. It turned out to be the
original, unbutchered Japanese version, and not the American version
with the false, switched around boss names. I played a couple of games
in Arcade mode as Kim Kaphwan with the K Groove. After defeating
Kyosuke and Sagat, I lost the third match to Raiden, and once I got
past him on my second try, I lost the fourth match to Geese Howard, and
then quit to get some sleep. But before I left, I gave one can of Bawls
to the guy running the game. After getting back to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171.jpg">my hotel room</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">, I packed more cans of Bawls in my suitcase; <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Hidden_Bawls.jpg">six in a meshed compartment</a>,
and two in the front pouch. I then went to bed to get what little sleep
I could before making the final preparations to head home.<br><br>&gt;
Around 8AM, my mother called me on my cell phone, waking me up. She
basically said to remember to call her once I got past security at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;">,
and to remind me to ask about the Shuttle Bus at the front desk. I left
my room for the last time at 9:30AM, and went down to the front desk to
check out. My next goal was to take&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: spaceone;" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Builds/CES_Log_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
and all of its equipment out of the BYOC room, so I went to the bell
stand to pick up a dolly so I could easily carry everything to the
Business Center. The man behind at bell stand asked me if I was packed
up and ready to go, but since CES wasn't packed up yet, he couldn't
give me a dolly right away, but told me to call 7530 for pickup once I
had gotten everything ready. <br><br>&gt; When I got to the BYOC room, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Clearing_Out.jpg">almost everyone had already left</a>,
and a few people were actually still playing in the final hours before
the teardown, which would begin at noon. It took me about an hour to
put CES and its components into their boxes, and I included five cans
of Bawls, which I wrapped in a clear garbage bag to contain any
potential leaks, and put them in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/CES_Box.jpg">CES's outer box</a>.
I also packed two cans in my backpack, totaling 15 cans to take home;
two in my backpack, five in CES's outer box, and eight in my suitcase.
When I brought my stuff to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/GLHF.jpg">BYOC room's exit</a>, the person checking me out tore up my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> 2008 Registration Sheet. I gave him two cans of Bawls in order to get rid of the last of my excess. <br><br>&gt;
Now that CES and its components were packed up, I walked towards a
hotel phone near my usual exit to call for a bellhop, but one had
already shown up to carry someone else's things. He offered to carry my
stuff if the person he was there for didn't show up in the next few
minutes. Those few minutes went by with no sign of the person who the
bellhop came to help, so he carried CES's box, my monitor, and my
suitcase, along with someone else's computer, to the main building.
After dropping off the other person's computer in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Hilton_Anatole_-_Tower_Lobby.jpg">tower lobby</a>,
he wheeled my things to the Business Center. Once there, I taped up
CES's box and the monitor box, and used shipping labels my mother had
prepared before the trip to <a href="http://fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a> the boxes to my home in New Jersey.<br><br>&gt;
With CES's box and the monitor soon to be on their way to Jersey, I was
down to just my suitcase and my backpack. While waiting for the Shuttle
Bus to Dallas Fort Worth, I had a chance to talk with some other
QuakeCon attendees, including some people who were playing <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a>
with me during the QuakeCon of 2006. Sometime later on in the
afternoon, I boarded the Shuttle Bus to DFW, where I had another brush
with the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_top">TSA nazis</a>.
Once again, my bags were checked thoroughly, and this time they found
all ten cans of Bawls I was carrying. I was given the option of
checking my luggage, but I decided that it wasn't worth the hassle, so
I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Confiscated_Bawls.jpg">let the Bawls go</a>. This time around, I caught my flight on time, and didn't have to deal with any&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"><a href="http://www.mastercard.com/index.html" target="_top">Mastercard</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> frequent flier miles assholes.<br><br>&gt;
Even though I ran into trouble with the TSA rent-a-cops before and
after the QuakeCon, the event itself was still very enjoyable. I played
and recorded four rounds of Quake 2, got a free T-shirt, and a few
people were actually interested in CES. When CES got to my house, I
found that none of the Bawls cans had leaked. Also, CES's hard drive
and the right cool touch handle had come loose from the shipping, but I
was able to easily fix that. I never did find out who won the case mod
contest, but given the entries that were far superior to CES, I think
that it's a safe bet that it wasn't me. I was originally planning on
going on this vacation with my uncle Jim and his three sons, but they
had to cancel due to more important priorities. I'm planning on going
to the QuakeCon again in 2010 when I can afford to drop another
thousand dollars, and hopefully I can convince my uncle Jim or someone
else to join me this time around.</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"><br></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span>
