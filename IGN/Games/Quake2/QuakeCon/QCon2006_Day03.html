- Day Three</font></font></font></p>

<span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; At around 12:30AM on Saturday
the 5th, there was yet another round of T-shirt throwing, this time
from the</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="_top">nVidia</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> stage. After walking to various places
in the crowd trying to find a good spot to catch a shirt, I found
myself on the right side of the stage (facing towards the stage), about
six feet away from it. The guy on stage saw me and threw a shirt
directly at my chest, and I managed to catch it unopposed. I went back
to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/CES_Setup%28Light%29.jpg">my
table</a> with my new</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> 2006 T-shirt, and put it in my
backpack for safe keeping. I spent the next few hours doing various
things, including watching some more</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://www.guitarherogame.com/" target="_top">Guitar Hero</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> for another hour or so, and then went
back to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Room_7187.jpg">my
room</a>, where I went to bed sometime before 5:30AM.<br>
<br>
&gt; After getting a few more hours of sleep, I went back to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/BYOC02.jpg">BYOC
room</a>, and went to the nVidia stage to enter <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Builds/CES_Log_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a> in a case mod contest which started a little
after 10AM. The catch was that this was an ugliest case mod contest,
but I thought that CES would have a chance because of its crude look,
mostly in the front panel which was made entirely of junk parts. The
woman who was hosting the contest called up the contestants one at a
time and asked us to describe our machines any why we thought they were
ugly. I was called up first, and I basicly said that CES's ugliness
came from its crude look, but some people in the crowd thought it was
pretty good looking. The other entries included a machine with no power
switch that had to be turned on and off by bridging the power switch
pins with a metal instrument, an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2006/Ugliest_Case01.avi" style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);">extremely
dusty box</a>, and a machine that was covered with decals and
belonged to the contestant's daughter. After the descriptions were
over, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2006/Ugliest_Case_-_Winners.avi" style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);">four finalists were chosen</a>,
and not surprisingly, I was not one of them. The host announced the
names of each of the four finalists in turn, and the crowd would cheer
according to how ugly they thought the finalist's case was. The winner
was Phat_Jesus, and his prize was the first pick between three brand
new computer cases, while second (Zebaca) and third (thatGUY) picked
from the other two. There was also an ugliest mouse and ugliest
keyboard contest, but since I was totally unprepared for either, I
brought CES back to my table and hooked it back up. <br>
<br>
&gt; Just before 1PM, I answered a request made from the Noc to
volunteer some time and give something back to the event. I found
myself sitting at the check out table close to the exit door, where I
spent the next four hours checking the boxes and bags of people exiting
the BYOC room, and comparing their items to their registration sheet.
One of the people who were checking out was SK|tox, a Swedish gamer who
was supposed to be one of the best</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://quake4.ravengames.com/" target="_top">Quake 4</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> players around. When my shift ended
around 5PM, I met Frankie at <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/PSH_-_ETQW.jpg">the
Activision section</a>, and he said he would meet me in the neighboring
room at 6PM. A little later on, I got to show Frankie CES, and he
seemed to like my case mod and asked about where I got the front panel,
what type of motherboard it used, etc. <br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime before 6PM, I was on CES when all of a sudden I heard
several people moan in disappointment all at once. At first, I had no
idea what they were upset about, but I soon realised that the power had
gone out in my part of the room. The only thing that kept me from
noticing the power outage right away was the fact that CES was hooked
up to my fully charged UPS, and this made hauling around the extra 40
pounds worthwhile. The people at the Noc <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2006/Blackout.avi">suggested that we unplug our machines</a>
in order to avoid drawing too much power from the generators at once. I
was afraid that there would be a power surge when the power was
restored, so I shut down CES and unplugged and turned off my UPS just
to be on the safe side, and the last thing I needed to do was risk
frying CES's third motherboard. <br>
<br>
&gt; With nothing to do on CES for a while, I went to the neighboring
room around 6PM where I met a few members of the</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycount</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
community, including Frankie,</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
Bronco</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">, and <a href="http://www.t3h-v.com/" target="_top">Mr. Rockstar</a>. We took some group photos, and so I
lent someone my </span><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">Cybershot</a></font><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
to take a couple shots with it. Unfortunately, the camera's battery was
very low, and the camera shut itself off before the guy could take the
shot. However, several cameras were being used, and so a few pictures
did manage to get taken, including <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v218/acepainkiller/qcon/qcon1.jpg">this
one</a>. As I was heading back to the BYOC room to see if power to my
section had yet been restored, I heard a crowd cheering in suspense at
something. When I took a closer look, I saw that two people were
stacking plastic cups really high. My camera couldn't stay on for more
than a few seconds, but I was lucky enough to get off <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Cup_Stacking.jpg">this
crude shot</a> of the stacking.<br>
<br>
&gt; When I got back to the BYOC room, I saw that the <a href="http://www.directron.com/" target="_top">Directron</a> people
were dismantling their booth, and nearly sold out all of their
merchandise. One of the few things they had left in stock were black xRaider
mousepads that had clear borders which were illuminated by LEDs. I
wanted to buy a green pad, but the only color pad the booth had left
were red ones. So I bought a red-lighted mousepad for $15, and figured
that I could replace the red LEDs with green ones after the trip. The
best part about the purchase is that I didn't have to pay a shipping
handling charge, and I didn't have to wait for it to arrive at my
house. However, </span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">a few days
later, </span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">sometime after I
got home from my vacation, I was disappointed to learn that I could
have bought a green LED version of the same pad at Directron.com for
less than ten bucks.<br>
<br>
&gt; Around 6:45, the Noc people announced that power in our section
would be restored in less that 15 minutes, so I turned the UPS and CES
back on without plugging the UPS back in. This way, CES would run off
of the UPS's battery, and the UPS's 50 minutes of power would be more
than enough to wait out the rest of the blackout. Even though I was
able to use my computer, I couldn't access the Internet, and this was
probably because the QuakeCon's router was offline. When the power was
still out 20 minutes later, I got a little worried that my UPS would
run out of juice before my section's power came back, so I decided that
if the power didn't come back in 20 minutes, I would shut down my
computer. But it never came to that, because my section's power was
restored half an hour after the announcement, so all I had to do was
plug the UPS back into the outlet. However, I still had to restart CES
to re-establish my Internet connection.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime around 10PM, I saw a small group of people gathered
around a computer three rows in front of me and making lots of noise. I
couldn't see what they were looking at, because their screen was facing
away from me. When I went over for a closer look, I saw that they were
watching lesbian porn, and this was distracting the guy playing <a href="http://www.q3arena.com/" target="_top">Quake 3</a> on the next
computer to the right, causing him to frequently get killed. Soon,
there was a contest going on in which people would take turns <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Quake3&amp;Pr0n.jpg">playing
Quake 3</a> with lesbian porn playing on the neighboring computer while
wearing the headphones that played the porn's audio for an added
distraction. After watching that bizzare contest for a few minutes, I
played a bit of</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/streetfighteralpha3/index.html" target="_top">Street Fighter Zero 3</a> on <a href="http://dazz.genmaygamers.com/" target="_top">Game Not Over</a></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">, and then spent the last couple hours
of the night on CES.</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span>
