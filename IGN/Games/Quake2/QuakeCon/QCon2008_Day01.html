<span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; My father dropped me off at <a href="http://www.phl.org/" target="_top">Philadelphia International Airport</a> sometime around 9:30AM. On this particular trip, I wanted to avoid another incident with&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: spaceone;" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Builds/CES_Log_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;">'s <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/CES_Box.jpg">box</a> not arriving at <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a>, so the previous week I had CES and its monitor <a href="http://fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a>ed straight to the hotel, which was the same&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><a href="http://www.hiltonmeetingstexas.com/dallas.aspx?WT.srch=1" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a><span style="font-family: spaceone;">
I stayed at in 2006. This left me carrying only a small suitcase and my
backpack. However, I made the mistake of ignoring a piece of advice
that my parents and a few other people had been giving me for several
years, and it finally caught up to me. I have a keychain that includes
a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log02/Swiss_Army_Knife_Saphire.jpg">Swiss Army Knife</a>,
which is considered contraband on the airlines. On previous flights, I
would put the keychain in a purple drink bottle in my luggage case, and
I would always manage to sneak it by the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_top">airport security nazis</a>.
This time around however, my luck ran out, as the TSA fascist pigs
pulled me aside, did a thorough search of my bags, found my hidden
keychain, and took away my knife, and this held me back half an hour. <br><br>&gt; After finding my gate (Gate B16), I did a 15-minute walk to Terminal A to have lunch at <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/" target="_top">McDonalds</a>.
My flight was scheduled to leave at 11:35AM, and it was almost 11AM, so
I knew I had to hurry back. Soon after reaching Terminal B, I only had
to reach Gate B16, but a group of <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/index.html" target="_top">Mastercard</a>
vendors pulled me aside to offer me free frequent flier miles. These
people were extremely pushy, begging me to hear what they had to say
even though I really had to catch my flight, and holding me back
another five minutes. To make matters worse, they somehow convinced me
to give them my Social Security Number. This pissed me off royally,
because I couldn't believe that I was dumb enough to give these pushy
motherfuckers my SSN, and this was further compounded by the fact that
I had missed my flight, even though I arrived at the gate a few minutes
before 11:35. I couldn't help but think that if I had just kept staring
straight ahead and just ignored the Mastercard assholes, I could have
caught my flight and could have already been in the air. <br><br>&gt;
I immediately went to the customer service desk for help, and the woman
behind the counter gave me a new ticket for a 2:20PM flight to Dallas
which would board at Gate C25. I spotted more Mastercard assholes as I
was walking through Terminal C, but this time I had the good sense to
stare straight ahead and totally ignore them when the called to me. But
I was <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2008/Creamy_Is_Pissed.avi">still pissed off</a>
about giving away my Social Security Number, that I turned off my phone
when my parents tried to call me on my cell phone. The last thing I
needed was my parents giving me the whole "I told you so" lecture, and
I didn't want to let them know that I did something so goddamn fucking
stupid as to give my SSN to people I didn't trust, so I kept my phone
off, and planned to not turn it back on until I had arrived in Dallas.<br><br>&gt;
I boarded my flight around 2PM, and arrived at Dallas Fort Worth after
4:30PM Texas time, then turned my phone back on as I had planned. After
a much needed bathroom break, I went to Baggage Claim to call for a
Shuttle Bus to the Hilton Anatole. I got <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2008/Shuttle_Bus.avi">on the bus</a>
around 5PM, and soon after I did my mother called me on my cell phone
and asked me why I hadn't been picking up my phone. I told her about me
losing my Swiss Army Knife to the airport nazis, and she gave me the
expected "I told you so" response. I was going to tell her about the
Mastercard dickheads and my missed initial flight, but she didn't want
to talk while I was in a bus with other people, so we agreed to finish
the conversation once I got to the hotel.<br><br>&gt; After arriving at the hotel around 6PM, the first thing I wanted to do was pick up CES and register it for the </span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>'s <span style="font-family: spaceone;">BYOC.
So I went to the Bell Stand and asked the man behind the podium where I
could find a package if I had one FedExed to the hotel. He directed me
to the Business Center, where I signed some sheet of paper and picked
up CES's box. But as soon as I did, it occured to me that maybe I
should have checked into my hotel room first so that I could put away
my suitcase and not have to carry that much more weight around.
Fortunately, the woman at the Business Center was nice enough to watch
my box as I went to the front desk to check in, but the desk clerk said
that even though the room was reserved, it was not actually paid for. I
called up my mother and handed the phone to the clerk, and after their
conversation, the clerk said that my mother would send her some fax,
and that this would resolve the payment issue. I figured that this
would be a good time to register for the BYOC, and hopefully the room
would be paid for by the time I got back to pick up my room key.<br><br>&gt;
The BYOC was being held in the same place it was in 2006; in Trinity
Hall, which was a building next to the hotel's main building. It would
be a long walk, so went back to the Bell Stand and asked for a dolly to
carry CES's box. A bellhop showed up with such a dolly, and after I led
him to the Business Center to pick up the box, we went to Trinity Hall
with CES's box and my suitcase</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/CES_Box_On_Dolly.jpg">on the dolly</a>,</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"> and I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Registration_Line.jpg">got in&nbsp;line</a> for the registration. There, I noticed that a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Crude_Arcade01.jpg">crude arcade</a> had been set up in the room, and included an <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2008/Air_Hockey.avi">air hockey table</a> and some classic <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Crude_Arcade02.jpg">8-bit arcade machines</a>. It took nearly an hour to reach the <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2008/Registration_Tables.avi">front of the line</a>,
where I registered CES and all of my equipment. The man behind the
desk, who went by the handle neon, read through a check list that was
based on my online registration and listed all the equipment I planned
to bring. When he got to the monitor, however, I realized that I had
left it in the Business Center. neon told me that because the monitor
was on the check list, and I had already been through the registration
process, I could just bring the monitor in without having to register
again. After being given a blank name tag that I immediately <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Creamy%27s_Name_Tag.jpg">wrote my name on</a>,
I&nbsp;went to another table where I was handed a sheet of paper called
the QuakeCon 2008 Registration Sheet. This paper would prove that I was
the rightful owner of my equipment, and I would need it to take my
things out of the BYOC room once the I was ready to go home.<br><br>&gt;
Once inside the BYOC room with CES, its equipment, and my luggage, I
was about to drag all 50+ pounds of my things through the room to find
a good table. However, someone at the BYOC front desk offered to watch
my things so I could carry CES and its parts one box at a time. I
wanted to set up near the main aisle in order to increase the chances
of CES appearing in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a>
video about the event, but couldn't find an end table. The table I
eventually did find was potentially better than that, since it was
right in front of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Strogg_Noc%28Light%29.jpg">Strogg NOC</a> (Network Operations Center), one of two main stages, in Row B14. I <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/CES_Pre-Setup.jpg">set everything up on that table</a>
minus the monitor, and began to notice a strange noise that was coming
from either CES or the UPS. I heard two beeps at regular intervals, but
I thought nothing of it at the time.<br><br>&gt; After setting up, I
returned to the hotel's front desk at around 8:30PM, and learned that
my room had since been paid for. The desk clerk gave me a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/4171_Folder.jpg">pamphlet-sized folder</a> that contained two copies of my room's keycard, and told me that my room would be number 4171 in the tower. When I got to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171.jpg">my room</a>, I was impressed by it's luxurious nature. It had a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171_-_Couch.jpg">full sized couch</a>, a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171_-_Desk.jpg">desk</a> that a business executive would own, a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171_-_Bed.jpg">king-sized bed</a>, and a really large <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Room_4171_-_TV.jpg">flat screen TV</a>.
I put one keycard in my wallet, and the other in my backpack to ensure
that I would not lock myself out. I took the opportunity to take a
shower, and I left my room around 10PM to pick up my monitor.
Unfortunately, the Business Center had already closed at 9PM, and
according to a sign on the door, it would open again at 6:30 the next
morning. I decided to pass the time away by getting something to eat,
then taking a rest in my room's king-sized bed.<br><br>&gt; I went to
the hotel's front desk to ask what pizza places in town delivered to
the Hilton Anatole. The desk clerk wrote down three Pizza places and
their phone numbers; <a href="http://www.dominos.com/home/index.jsp" target="_top">Domino's</a>, <a href="http://www.papajohns.com/index.htm" target="_top">Papa John's</a>, and <a href="http://www.zinispizza.com/" target="_top">Zini's Pizzeria</a>.
Starting at the top of the list, I called Domino's, and they put me on
hold for nearly five minutes. I was only seconds away from hanging up
and moving on to Papa John's when someone answered. I ordered a medium
pepperoni pie, a 2 liter bottle of <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp" target="_top">Coke</a>,
and some Cinnasticks, and was told that the order would take one to two
hours to get to the hotel. I was told that I would receive a call when
the delivery driver arrived so that I could meet him in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Hilton_Anatole_-_Tower_Lobby.jpg">tower's lobby</a>.
When I was in the BYOC room earlier that night, I had taken off my name
tag since it was getting in the way, so I took it off, but had
forgotten to take it with me when I left. So I figured that retrieving
my tag would be a good way to kill off some of the one to two hours I
would have to wait for the pizza. I was able to get into the BYOC room
by showing my Registration Sheet to the front desk there, and agreeing
to have someone escort me to CES. I found my name tag under my table
hanging on some wires, and when I showed the badge to my escort, he was
satisfied and left towards the BYOC's front desk. <br><br>&gt; I went
back to the tower's lobby to wait for the pizza delivery person to show
up, and around 11:30PM, he called me on my cell phone and said he was
pulling up to the hotel. When I along with several other QuakeCon
attendees met him outside, he was carrying two large cube-shaped bags.
We all went back inside, figured out who ordered what, then paid for
our meals. I tipped the delivery person two dollars, then took my order
back up to my hotel room, but soon after I got there, I realized that I
got the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2008/Wrong_Order.jpg">wrong side order</a>
and not the Cinnasticks I wanted, but it was too late to change things
now. I ended the night by having two slices of pepperoni with some
Coke, brushing and flossing my teeth, and then going to bed at midnight.<br></span><span style="font-family: spaceone;"></span>
