2003
- Day Three</font></font></font></p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; Just before 2AM, I was up front at the
noc,
watching </font><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a></font><font face="SpaceOne"> up
close.
All of a sudden, the guys on the noc announced that they were giving
away free T-shirts, and then all hell broke loose. A crowd of about a
hundred
people rushed to the noc at once, like water from a bursting dam.
Nash,
who was on the noc, tossed the shirts one by one into the crowd, and
they grabbed at every shirt. Some staggered and fell as they made some
of the bolder grabs, and some of the shorter people stood on top of
chairs
to get some extra height. I was still up front, trapped in by the
crowd,
and I was unable to get back to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/Glamdring02.jpg">Glamdring</a>
until they dispersed. Sometime
later, I went back to my room, brushed my teeth, recharged my cell
phone,
and went to bed just after 4:30AM.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; I woke up at around 10:30AM, took a
shower,
changed into my Bart Simpson playing Space Invaders T-shirt, and called
my mother in <a href="http://www.cityofaventura.com/" target="_top">Aventura</a>.
I told her about my trip so far, and she reminded me to find out when
the
hotel's check out time was, and to call the <a href="http://www.shuttlebus-zoom.com/" target="_top">ShuttleBus</a>
company to take me to the airport the next day. I went down to the
lobby
to ask if there was a microwave I could use to heat up my now cold
pizza,
but apparently there wasn't one. I went to the only working vending
machine,
which was on the fourth floor, but it was out of the sodas that I like.
Luckily, some people were selling soda and snacks on the second floor,
so I picked up a cold can of Coke for a dollar. I then went to my room,
had two slices of cold pizza, then went back to the BYOC room.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; I arrived back at Glamdring just before
1PM,
just on time for the second round of the Generations tournament. I
played
against a player called Dink, and basically <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QCon2003_Gen_Dink.dm_68">got
my ass handed to me</a>. I lost 27 frags to -1, but I had a good time
nevertheless.
My defeat revealed to me how much I really suck at Quake, and that I
need
to do some substantial practicing if I ever want to become serious
tournament
material. So I'll try to fit Quake practice into my busy schedule,
along
with studying for my yet to be scheduled </font><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://certification.comptia.org/a/" target="_top">A+
Certification</a></font><font face="SpaceOne"> exam, my job
at <a href="http://www.ladyfootlocker.com/" target="_top">Lady Foot
Locker</a>,
and tending Creamy's Wonderland.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; The rest of the day was rather
uneventful, but
entertaining nevertheless. I played a bit more <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/" target="_top">Q3A</a>,
and recorded a few of my games, but unfortunately I somehow lost the
recordings.
I also browsed the network, downloading some songs, and purging one
machine
of its 30+ viruses with my copy of <a href="http://www.symantec.com/nav/nav_9xnt/" target="_top">Norton
AntiVirus</a>. After the system was clean, I left a text file on the
once-infected
computer explaining what I'd done. I even preserved <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/QuakeCon_2003_-_Virus_Log.doc" target="_top">the
QuakeCon section of Glamdring's virus log</a> for your viewing pleasure.</font></p>
