2006
- Day Two</font></font></font></p>

<span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; I started out the second day
of the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
listening to mp3 and surfing the Web on <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/CES_Setup%28Dark%29.jpg">CES</a>,
as well as playing <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/streetfighteralpha3/index.html" target="_top">Street Fighter Zero 3</a> on <a href="http://dazz.genmaygamers.com/" target="_top">Game Not Over</a>,
a modded PC that was built to look like a life size arcade machine, and
ran a <a href="http://mamedev.org/" target="_top">MAME</a> emulator.
It had controls to support up to four players, but only the first two
sets of controls were functional. The machine ran about a hundred
different games, including <a href="http://www.pixelpower.on.ca/dl/" target="_top">Dragon's Lair</a>, <a href="http://www.guitarherogame.com/" target="_top">Guitar Hero</a>,
and <a href="http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10441" target="_top">Windjammers</a>. Just before 3:30AM, some people on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Noc%28Light%29.jpg">Noc</a>,
the stage in the center of the BYOC, announced that they were giving
away free T-shirts, and soon several people rush in and surrounded the
Noc. Several people on the Noc, including <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/forums/member.php?userid=56" target="_top">Nash</a>, began tossing T-shirts into the crowd at
random. They then pointed to each of the Noc's four sides and asked the
crowd on each side to scream, and then they threw several shirts to the
loudest side. I was among the people who tried to grab a shirt, but
unfortunately I struck out. Later on, I took my first shower of the
event, and then went back to bed around 6AM, and got managed to get
another three and a half hours of sleep.<br>
<br>
&gt; At 11AM, I took part in my first competition of the QuakeCon. It
was a photo scavenger hunt, and each contestant was given a list of
things to take pictures of. The rules were to photograph as many items
on the list, and we only had one hour to take the pictures, and burn
them to a CD. The items included booths in the BYOC room, decorations
in the hotel's main building, attendees wearing T-shirts of previous
QuakeCons, and a variety of other things. Around 11:45PM, after taking
several pictures, I realized that I had no way to burn them to a CD, so
I was forced to withdraw from the contest. <br>

<span style="font-family: spaceone;"><br>
&gt; Sometime after 1PM, the QuakeCon staff was tossing more T-shirts
into a crowd of eager attendees. This time, it was being done from the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html" target="_top">nVidia</a>
stage instead of the Noc, and the shirts were being tossed by some guy
in a black <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Stilts.jpg">Doom
marine-like costume on stilts</a>. I was somewhere in the back of the
crowd in another attempt to grab myself a free shirt, and even though I
came close to grabbing two shirts, I was unsuccessful again. I did
however manage to take some <a style="color: rgb(128, 255, 255);" href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Movies/QCon2006/T-Shirt_Toss.avi">footage</a>
of the T-shirt toss on my </span><font face="SpaceOne"><a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">Sony Cybershot digital camera</a></font><span style="font-family: spaceone;">.<br>
<br>
&gt; Besides the nVidia stage, there was also an <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/nVidia_Booth.jpg">nVidia
booth</a> on the other side of the BYOC room that was giving away free
stuff of its own, which were primarily <a href="http://www.enemyterritory.com/" target="_top">Enemy
Territory</a> T-shirts and lighted disks. These domed, plastic disks
had paper backs, and when the paper side was crushed in, the disk would
give off this bright green glow, and then fade gradually over the
course of a few hours. I took a shirt and a disc, and put the disc <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Disc_In_CES%28Light%29.jpg">inside
CES's chassis</a> on top of the CD drive to give CES a <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Disc_In_CES%28Dark%29.jpg">temporary
extra glow</a>. Other people also used the discs to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Discs_On_PCs%28Dark%29.jpg">enhance
their case mods</a> as well, and some were even wearing theirs <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Discs_On_Back.jpg">on
their clothes</a>, or even <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Discs_As_Clothing%28Front%29.jpg">as
the clothing itself</a>. <br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: spaceone;">&gt; At 2PM, a Guitar Hero
tournament began at the nVidia stage. Guitar Hero is a music oriented
game for the <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/" target="_top">Playstation
2</a>, in which two players follow rhythmic patterns on the screen on
guitar-like controllers while music plays in the background. The songs
included several songs I grew up listening to, including Killer Queen
by <a href="http://www.queenonline.com/" target="_top">Queen</a>, and
Iron Man by <a href="http://www.black-sabbath.com/" target="_top">Black
Sabbath</a>. Since I had never played the game before, I decided not to
play myself, but to just enjoy it as a spectator. I watched this
tournament on and off throughout the next two days, taking several
pictures and shooting a few movies. <br>

<span style="font-family: spaceone;"><br>
&gt; Later on that night, I saw that even more free stuff was being
tossed into a crowd, this time from a stage close to the <a href="http://www.activision.com/en_US/home/home.jsp" target="_top">Activision</a>
section where the official <a href="http://quake4.ravengames.com/" target="_top">Quake 4</a> and Enemy Territory tournaments were being
played. This time around, mousepads and orange balls were being given
away instead of T-shirts. One of the mousepads landed in an empty booth
that was immediately to my left, so I climbed over the barrier into the
booth to grab it, but someone beat me to it by about one second.
Luckily, a second pad landed in the booth, and I managed to snag this
one. I went over to CES, put my tiny blue mousepad in the ice maker
box, and replaced it with the new <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2006/Patriot_Memory_Mousepad.jpg">Patriot
Memory pad</a> I had just gotten.<br>
<br>
&gt; I spent the next few hours playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time" target="_top">TMNT: Turtles In Time</a> on Game Not Over, and watching
some more Guitar Hero. I also downloaded a few replacement icons for
some of CES's folders, and downloaded <a href="http://fms.komkon.org/iNES/" target="_top">iNES</a>, an 8-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_top">NES</a> emulator that ran on <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_top">Linux</a>. The ROMs I got
with the emulator included <a href="http://doubledragon.classicgaming.gamespy.com/dd2shrine/" target="_top">Double Dragon 2</a>, <a href="http://www.nesplayer.com/reviews/baddudesr.htm" target="_top">Bad
Dudes</a>, and <a href="http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/nes/vice.htm" target="_top">Vice: Project Doom</a>, and while the games ran a bit
fast and choppy, I still had some fun with them. Three tables in front
of me, there was a group of players from <a href="http://tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">tastyspleen</a>, an
online
community that runs <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a> servers. One of the players was running a
version of the game called <a href="http://egl.quakedev.com/" target="_top">EGL</a> Quake 2, which ran the game with super-enhanced
graphics, making some of the objects glow much more brightly. I tried
to join the game the tastyspleen guys were playing, but even through I
was given the IP address of their server, I still couldn't connect to
it on CES.</span>
