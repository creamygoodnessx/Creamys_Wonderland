<p><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; On the morning of the 11th, Goatman
and I enjoyed breakfast at the local <a href="http://www.ihop.com/" target="_top">IHOP</a>
before heading back to the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QCon</a>.
We again parted ways, and I headed back to Glamdring, where I played a
little <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-arena/" target="_top">Q3A</a>
and some <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake2/" target="_top">Quake2</a>,
and even explored other players' machines through the network. That
evening,
my parents showed up and brought their camera, right on time to take a
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2001/Polycounters%28QCon2001%29_01.jpg">group
shot</a> of several of the <a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycounters</a>,
myself included. Right after that, my dad took me out to <a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/" target="_top">Pizza
Hut</a>, and after about a 20 minute wait, returned to QCon with a
large
pepperoni pie and a large Pepsi. When I walked into the room with all
the
machines, I noticed about a dozen people gathered around a machine in
the
back of the room. The computer was connected to a machine called
Fullgore,
which had a whole bunch of really funny and/or shocking short clips.
These
clips included people falling off bicycles, failed stunts, fighter
plane
crashes, bizarre accidents, and some other interesting stuff. A
favorite
clip amongst the onlookers seemed to be one of a sleeping cat that
suddenly
woke up and pounced headfirst into a wall. While I was enjoying my
pizza
and playing Quake, the next to me told me that the guys at <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/index.php?flash=true&amp;version=6" target="_top">id
Software</a> were playing against all comers in two-on-two <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake3-teamarena/" target="_top">Q3
Team Arena</a>. So I went to the next room where the action was, and
noticed
that Tim Willits, Todd Hollenshead, Marty Stratton, and some other id
guy
were sitting together at a row of machines. I got in line and tried to
recruit rogue13 as my partner, but he declined, leaving me desperately
seeking another partner. Just as I approached the front of the line, I
saw Hunter, Mike
Jukes, and a few other Polycounters walk into the room. Hunter agreed
to be my Quake partner, and we played against Willits and the id guy
whose
name I can't remember. We lost six captures to zero, and I only got in
one frag. Later on in the night, when I was back on Glamdring, I
noticed
a Quake3 team tournament starting on my table, and on nearby tables.
There
was this one player who was sitting at my left, who was screaming
profanities
throughout the tournament. Every time he did, another player would
shout
'LANGUAGE!'. I don't know why, but I actually found that rather
entertaining.
Sometime after midnight, I noticed some people playing <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/starcraft/" target="_top">Starcraft</a>.
I did have some trouble getting on to their network, but after they
helped
me change a few of my network settings, and after we all upgraded to
the
latest version of <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/broodwar/" target="_top">Starcraft:
Brood War</a>, we played a four-on-four all Terran game. My team
managed
to bring down two of the enemy players, but the other two quickly
regrouped
and got the upper hand. We all ended up allying with each other,
drawing
the match. I even <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QCon2001_SC_AllTerran.rep" target="_top">saved
the match on disk</a>, so I could watch it again anytime. I then picked
up a few last files from the network before disconnecting and heading
back
to the <a href="http://www.comfortinn.com/" target="_top">Comfort Inn</a>.
When Goatman and I returned, it was like 3 in the morning.</font></p>
