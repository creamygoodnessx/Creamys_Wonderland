I have a double-whammy for you all today. Yesterday, I completed Config
File Setup no-frills Scene 7. As a result, the draft versions of all
the scenes of CFS are now complete. And if that's not enough of an
update
for you, I've applied the voice-overs for the first three scenes this
morning,
promoting them to release versions! To accommodate these upgrades, I
have
redesigned the Media section of the CFS page. All this good news puts
me
halfway through Tier 7, with 10 days to go!</font></font>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ffccff">12/1/2K (Follycount) -</font><font color="#cc66cc"> And
now begins a new tier. Tier 7 consists of four tasks, and although on
average
they aren't too difficult to complete, the shortened deadline in this
tier
will keep this a challenge. The stakes are higher than usual, because
my
2D Computer Animation 2 class ends on the 19th, and as you know,
Config
File Setup is my class project.</font></font>

</font><font color="#cc66cc">Woah
boy, have I got news for you today. All of the voice-overs for scenes 1
through 3 of Config
File Setup have been recorded. I re-rolled the RTS (race, type, style)
of the Scene 2 sniper yesterday, and determined the model will be a
human
male adult in the style of Craig Bartlett's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold%21" target="_top">Hey Arnold</a>.
In order to take
some of the burden off of this page, I've added a new BJQ2T news
archive
section to it.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; I've decided to
change
the layout of the Goodies pages. Since uploading large files has always
been a bitch for me, I think it might be better if episodes of BJQ2T
were
available only in parts. As a result, I've eliminated the Episodes page
of Config File Setup, and changed the drafts page's name to 'Media'.
This
will make it easier for me to upload the episodes to IWOW, and
hopefully,
for you to download them as well.</font></font>

sixth scene of no-frills Config
File Setup is now officially behind me. It took me twenty days to
finish,
and I'm two weeks behind schedule, but the important thing is that the
ass-itch is out of the way. My next assignment is acquiring the
voice-overs
for the first three scenes of CFS, but that task is already underway.</font></font>

After about a week of hard labor, I've gotten all six parts of the
no-frills
version of Scene 5 of Config
File Setup finished, but I'm going into Tier 6 with two scenes yet
to be completed. It took the use of <a href="http://www.hash.com" target="_top">Animation:
Master</a>, <a href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="_top">Paint Shop Pro</a>,
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_top">Adobe</a>
After Effects, and Adobe Premiere to pull this off. Instead of trying
to
complete the entire no-frills CFS in a single tier like I've been
trying
to do for the past two tiers, I'll try to focus on one scene of the
episode
per tier. This may be a wise decision since Scene 6 of CFS is a
seven-parter,
and the final scene of the episode involves something I've never
experimented
with before. As for the other tasks in Tier 6, I plan to post a few
concept
sketches of the first extra character, and do some of the voice overs
for
the first three scenes.</font></font>

BJQ2T Goodies section of IWOW is now officially up and running. Right
now,
the pickings are rather slim, as I only have three draft movies and a
script
in store. These movies can be found in a new Drafts section in this
page
along with any future movies of the project, and use a DivX compressor,
which is the best one I've seen for when you really need them small. <b><blink>In
order to view any of the movies on IWOW, you must have the DivX
compressor
installed on your machine.</blink></b> You can find the compresser at <a href="http://www.divx.com/" target="_top">DivX

month, another tier out of the way. The first three scences of the
no-frills
version of Config File Setup are done, however, due to the cruel change
in <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/" target="_top">Fortunecity</a>'s
linking policy, I'm unable to show you the scenes. I'll
probably be able to show you my work on the project sometime in this
new
tier (Tier 5), but until then, please bear with me.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; Since so much of
the project
revolves around the completion of the draft version of CFS, I can't
really
add anything new in this tier. Most of the other tasks I have planned
are
ultimately dependant on the draft, so finishing it is priority number
one.
I've decided to cut back even further on the rest of my tasks, and as a
result, the only other task in this tier is the shuttlecar station
design.</font></font>

the completion of Brandy Hothiegh's VWEP, I am now finished with Tier
3. I am six days ahead of schedule, and will begin the next tier
tomorrow.
Combining those six days with the thirty days of next month, I'll have
36 days to finish Tier 4. Since there are three tasks in Tier 4, and
since
I'm dividing the workload evenly amongst these tasks, I'll have 12 days
to finish each task. I just hope that I stay this far ahead of my
schedule,
or better yet, increase my lead on it even further. Only time will tell.</font></font></p>
