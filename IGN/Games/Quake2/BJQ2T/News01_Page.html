<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/1/2K - After about
a week of hard labor, I've gotten all six parts of the no-frills version
of Scene 5 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a> finished, but I'm going into Tier 6 with two scenes yet
to be completed. It took the use of <a href="http://www.hash.com" target="_top">Animation:
Master</a>, <a href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="_top">Paint Shop Pro</a>,
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_top">Adobe</a>
After Effects, and Adobe Premiere to pull this off. Instead of trying to
complete the entire no-frills CFS in a single tier like I've been trying
to do for the past two tiers, I'll try to focus on one scene of the episode
per tier. This may be a wise decision since Scene 6 of CFS is a seven-parter,
and the final scene of the episode involves something I've never experimented
with before. As for the other tasks in Tier 6, I plan to post a few concept
sketches of the first extra character, and do some of the voice overs for
the first three scenes.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/16/2K - The BJQ2T
Goodies section of IWOW is now officially up and running. Right now, the
pickings are rather slim, as I only have three draft movies and a script
in store. These movies can be found in a new Drafts section in this page
along with any future movies of the project, and use a DivX compressor,
which is the best one I've seen for when you really need them small. <b><blink>In
order to view any of the movies on IWOW, you must have the DivX compressor
installed on your machine.</blink></b> You can find the compresser at <a href="http://divx.ctw.cc/" target="_top">DivX
;-)</a>. Expect more goodies to come in the future and enjoy! :)</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/1/2K - Another month,
another tier out of the way. The first three scences of the no-frills version
of Config File Setup are done, however, due to the cruel change in Fortunecity's
linking policy, I'm unable to show you the scenes. I'll probably be able
to show you my work on the project sometime in this new tier (Tier 5),
but until then, please bear with me.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> Since so much of the
project revolves around the completion of the draft version of CFS, I can't
really add anything new in this tier. Most of the other tasks I have planned
are ultimately dependant on the draft, so finishing it is priority number
one.&nbsp; I've decided to cut back even further on the rest of my tasks,
and as a result, the only other task in this tier is the shuttlecar station
design.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">9/23/2K - Due to the
difficulty of the no frills version of Config File Setup, I've decided
to postpone the designs of Catacombs 10 South entrance and the shuttlecar
station until a later tier.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">8/25/2K - With the completion
of Brandy Hothiegh's VWEP, I am now finished with <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T/Tier3_Page.html">Tier
3</a>. I am six days ahead of schedule, and will begin the next tier tomorrow.
Combining those six days with the thirty days of next month, I'll have
36 days to finish Tier 4. Since there are three tasks in Tier 4, and since
I'm dividing the workload evenly amongst these tasks, I'll have 12 days
to finish each task. I just hope that I stay this far ahead of my schedule,
or better yet, increase my lead on it even further. Only time will tell.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">8/1/2K - Well, well,
well. Another month, another tier. Compared to the last two tiers, Tier
3 shouldn't be too much of a problem. Config File Setup will be the first
movie of the project, and my biggest obstacle now is finding someone to
play the voice of Brandy.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/27/2K - It's near
the end of Tier 2, and I've decided to make a last minute change to my
schedule. Tier 3 will revolve around the development of first version of
my first movie in the tactical guide. It will focus on config files, what
they are, and the method I use to write them. Because of the trouble I've
been having on the Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage VWEP, and because of the
new direction I'm taking the project, I will suspend the development of
the VWEP.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/1/2K - It now looks
like I'm a little behind on this project. Sometimes, it's amazing how fast
a commanding lead over your schedule can dissolve before your eyes.&nbsp;
I spent the past few days busting my ass on a project for school, but now
that the semester is over, I can finally move on to what's really important.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">6/4/2K - A few days
ago, I began work on a new project. In an effort to eventually work up
the will to begin future projects on my Into the Fray Universe, I've decided
to start an Internet series of a different kind. It will be a strategic
and tactical guide to Quake2, aptly named Brandy and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics.
The show will consist of several Quicktime movies, and will cover everything
from rocket jumping to setting up config files. This new project should
be easier that ITF:HON for two reasons. First of all, I'll require far
less help than I did for ITF:HON. I will need someone to play the voice
of Brandy Hothiegh, but other than that and some occasional advice on a
few things, I'll going to be just fine. Second, I'm giving myself ample
time to finish the project, a month for each tier to be exact. Even with
school and the possibility of getting a new job, I should be able to finish
the tiers on time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> The BJQ2T project
will consist of five one month-long tiers, each consisting of a certain
number of tasks. Much like the ITF:HON project, the tasks in each tier
will remain in place until completed or until the tier is finished. If
time on any given tier expires, its tasks will carry over to the next tier,
and must be completed in addition to the tasks that tier. If a tier is
completed significantly early, I'll give myself a day or two off from the
project, then begin the next tier with its original deadline still in place.
In other words, I'll have even more time to work on each task of that tier,
and will be way ahead of schedule. If I complete all five tiers, I will
take start to take it easy on BJQ2T, and work on it without any further
official scheduling.</font></font>
