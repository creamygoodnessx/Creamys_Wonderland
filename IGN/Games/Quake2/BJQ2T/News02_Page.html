<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">2/18/2001 - The eighth
tier of the BJQ2T project drew to a close today. Even though I'm three
days late on finishing the tier, I'm still glad that it's now behind me.
During today's earliest hours, after busting my ass for about a month and
a half, I finished the first draft version of the second part of Scene
4 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>. Unfortunately, I had no time left over in this tier for
modeling the sniper's head. Oh well, there's always Tier 9 for that.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/9/2001 - Today, I
finished the first release version of Scene 7 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>. It's not part of the Tier 8 lineup, but it's something
I consider to be 'extra credit', so I won't be stuck with it in a future
tier. Also today, I added a new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T/Update_Page.html">Update
Info</a> section to this page. It basically explains what a movie file
on IWOW needs to have in order to be classified as draft, release, or final.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">1/7/2001 - There's not
too much to report today, except this morning's completion of the first
release version of Scene 6 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>, and a slight design change of the Sniper in Scene 2. This
leaves me about seven weeks to get the other two tasks of Tier 8 finished.
That is all.</font></font>

7</a> has come to an end, now that I've completed and published the concept
sketches of the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">CFS</a>
Scene 2 sniper. Now, with many of the crucial parts of the episode finished,
I've decided to slow down the pace of the project so I can work on other
things, primarily the Brandy Hothiegh Quake2 PPM I plan to release to <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
in a couple of months. In order to make absolutely sure that it's possible
for me to finish Tier 8 on time, I'm giving myself a month and a half to
finish it.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/20/2K - For the past
few days, I've really been busy, primarily because of the December 19th
deadline on BJQ2T as my 2D Computer Animation 2 project. I managed to get
Version 1.1 of the first three scenes of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>, and Version 0.1 of Scene 4 to videotape, and present it
to the class. My presentation wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would
be, and I feel I could have shown a better version of my work if I was
given the time. The voice-overs for Scenes 5 though 7 are now completed,
and yesterday I made the release version of Scene 5 available to the public.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> Because of the short
length of Tier 7, and considering the work that's left in the tier, I've
decided to extend the deadline of the tier to this Christmas. That should
be enough time to get Tier 7's fourth and final task out of the way. You
may have noticed the new button at the bottom of this page. This is because
I've started a new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T/ConfigList_Page.html">References</a>
section of the BJQ2T pages. This new page will contain certain lists and
charts mentioned in the show. Giving these lists and charts their own page
will make the show move along a lot faster than if they were included in
the movies. Also added is a Credits section, one of which will be included
in every episode main page, along with Drafts and Script.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> I apologize for keeping
you in the dark for so long about the updates, but as I said, this project
has kept me very busy. That and my job at Lord and Taylor.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/9/2K - I have a double-whammy
for you all today. Yesterday, I completed <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a> no-frills Scene 7. As a result, the draft versions of all
the scenes of CFS are now complete. And if that's not enough of an update
for you, I've applied the voice-overs for the first three scenes this morning,
promoting them to release versions! To accommodate these upgrades, I have
redesigned the Media section of the CFS page. All this good news puts me
halfway through Tier 7, with 10 days to go!</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">12/1/2K - And now begins
a new tier. Tier 7 consists of four tasks, and although on average they
aren't too difficult to complete, the shortened deadline in this tier will
keep this a challenge. The stakes are higher than usual, because my 2D
Computer Animation 2 class ends on the 19th, and as you know,
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a> is my class project.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/29/2K - Woah boy,
have I got news for you today. All of the voice-overs for scenes 1 through
3 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a> have been recorded. I re-rolled the RTS (race, type, style)
of the Scene 2 sniper yesterday, and determined the model will be a human
male adult in the style of Craig Bartlett's Hey Arnold. In order to take
some of the burden off of this page, I've added a new BJQ2T news archive
section to it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> I've decided to change
the layout of the Goodies pages. Since uploading large files has always
been a bitch for me, I think it might be better if episodes of BJQ2T were
available only in parts. As a result, I've eliminated to Episodes page
of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>, and changed the drafts page's name to 'Media'. This will
make it easier for me to upload the episodes to IWOW, and hopefully, for
you to download them as well.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">11/24/2K - The sixth
scene of no-frills <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a> is now officially behind me. It took me twenty days to finish,
and I'm two weeks behind schedule, but the important thing is that the
ass-itch is out of the way. My next assignment is acquiring the voice-overs
for the first three scenes of CFS, but that task is already underway.</font></font>
