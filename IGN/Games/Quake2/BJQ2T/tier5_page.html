<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEADLINE:
10/20/2K - Probably the most challenging task of Tier 4, and definitely
the most important, I plan to build a draft version of the CFS movie in
<a href="http://www.hash.com">Animation:
Master</a>. A few shots will be left out in order to help me to push this
draft movie out the door ASAP. Differences between the draft version of
CFS and its future completed version are as follows. There will be no sound
at all, and the draft will lack the character lip movement the final version
will have. There will be no civilian extras in the draft, and the scenes
will be built with only the parts of the background that interact with
Brandy and Jatoten, such as the benches in the shuttlecar. With the exception
of the elevator and its doors, textures will almost be completely left
out of the draft. The soldiers in the cut scene will be temporarily played
by some of the models on the AM2000 CD.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">> As time and the tiers
go on, I will gradually add in the different elements of the Config File
Setup movie, starting with the voices in the next tier, lip sync in the
sixth, as well as a few others. Each scene will be its own AVI file. Even
with two extra days per task in this tier, it wouldn't surprise me if this
task causes me to fall behind again.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/21/2K - This morning,
I finished the first of four parts of Scene 4 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">Config
File Setup</a>. It's about a day in the life of an unfortunate keyboarder.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> In order to ensure
that I stay on schedule, I've decided to cut back a little on no-frills
CFS. Rather than continuing with the remaining three parts of Scene 4,
I've decided to move right on to Scene 5, in the hopes that it's an easier
task than the hell that Scene 4 has put me through all month long. This
may mean designing a rough layout of Catacombs 10 South of the Chiddetny
Gargantuan, but with my weekend vacation in Virginia coming up in a few
hours, I guess I'll have nothing better to offer the project for the next
couple days. I am also postponing the design of the shuttlecar station
for the second consecutive tier so I can get this damn thing done already.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> After pondering this
issue for the past couple days, I've finally decided what the two criteria
will be for any version of BJQ2T to be considered full (v1.x). First, the
episode must include all of the crucial parts of each scene, and be able
to tell the entire story accurately in it's present from (not including
sound). The only parts of any scene that may be omitted are the ones which
exist purely as a supplement for the scene's important parts. For example,
Scene 4 of Config File Setup is a four-parter, and is about a keyboarder
who gets gang raped by more experienced players. The first part alone is
enough to get the point across that keyboarders are usually the prime targets
during a deathmatch, while the other three parts are there to emphasize
this point, and to add further excitement to the episode. Therefore, only
the first part is really needed in order to make CFS an official full episode.
The second criteria for a full episode is that all of the crucial voice
tracks are included.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/1/2K - The first
three sections of the no-frills version of Config File Setup are now completed
(in the nick of time, mind you). However, I STILL don't have access to
a server with sufficient bandwidth to show my work on. :( I'll keep this
section active in the next tier, and display the link to the draft of CFS
once I find a suitable host server. For now, all I can show you are these
pics as an appetizer. In the middle pic, the two models are those that
I borrowed off of the <a href="http://www.hash.com" target="_top">Animation:
Master '98</a> CD. I will eventually replace them with original models.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">9/29/2K - I got the
second section of no-frills CFS out of my way yesterday. But until I can
find another hosting site to display movies, I won't be able to show any
movies. My 5-meg limitation on my <a href="http://nis.net/index.html" target="_top">NIS</a>
account doesn't help my situation either :(.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">> It looks like I'm
not going to be able to finish this task by the end of the month. :( In
order to compensate, I will focus on just the first three scenes. This
means that I'll have to change my plans for Tier 5, and probably won't
do any voice recording until the sixth tier. Hopefully by tomorrow, I'll
be able to show you what I've been working for the past month.</font></font>

the first section of the no frills version of CFS early this morning. Unfortunately,
due to the new bullshit policy at Fortunecity, I'm unable to post a working
link to the movie from any non-Fortunecity server. >:(. But don't despair,
I'll try to get this fixed by the next update.</font></font>

10/31/2K - The object here is to design the shuttlecar station featured
in the Config File Setup movie, then publish it here on this page. It's
where Brandy and Jatoten arrive near the start of the movie. Because of
the overwhelming task of no-frills CFS, I've had to put off this task until
a later tier. Well, it turns out that that tier is this one. I just hope
I get around to it this time. :D</font></font>
