<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">> Here's how the Follycount
movies are updated and classified on IWOW. First, I create a quick and
dirty preview of what to expect, in the form of a draft version movie.
As long as a scene is in it's draft stage, it will be classified as Version
0.x. The primary functions of the draft movies are to create a foundation
on which to build the release versions of the Follycount episodes on, and
to give the public a quick and dirty preview of things to come. The two
most important features of any draft movie in this project are proper timing
and ease of upgrading. Draft scenes are compressed in the medium quality,
super-compressed DivX Fast Motion format.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">> A scene is officially
dubbed 'release' when the crucial parts are included, and when the voice
track and other necessary sounds are applied to the scene. Release versions
are classified as Version 1.x and higher, and are preceded by a five second
IWOW splash screen. (I plan to improve on this screen at some later date.)
After that, upgrades to the scene include smoothing out the camera movement,
'humanizing' the animations, adding in backgrounds, adding in the extra
models, and a few other improvements as well. Like the draft versions,
release versions will also be compressed in Fast Motion. All draft and
release movie files that are in excess of 10 megs in file size will be
zipped. If any zip files exceed 10 megs, sound quality will be sacrificed
in order to bring down the file size.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">> After all conceivable
upgrades have been made to a scene, it is dubbed 'final' and compressed
in the higher quality Low Motion DivX format. After which, only previously
unforeseen critical errors can persuade me to make further upgrades to
the scene, at which time lesser changes can also be made. Only scenes in
their final versions may exceed 10 megs.</font></font>
