I'm almost ready to begin actively working on Follycount as an Internet
series, but first, there is one thing I have to take care of before
that
happens. The first Follycount movie I plan on making will be one of my
trailers, although I haven't yet decided on exactly which one I'll be
working
on. Whichever one it ends up being, I'll have to come up with a
detailed
script for it, much like the one for Config File Setup. Once the script
is done, Tier 1 of Follycount will commence, officially getting this
damn
thing off the ground.</font></font>

eighth tier of the BJQ2T project drew to a close today. Even though I'm
three days late on finishing the tier, I'm still glad that it's now
behind
me. During today's earliest hours, after busting my ass for about a
month
and a half, I finished the first draft version of the second part of
Scene
4 of Config
File Setup. Unfortunately, I had no time left over in this tier for
modeling the sniper's head. Oh well, there's always Tier 9 for that.</font></font>

</font><font color="#cc66cc">Today,
I finished the first release version of Scene 7 of Config
File Setup. It's not part of the Tier 8 lineup, but it's something
I consider to be 'extra credit', so I won't be stuck with it in a
future
tier. Also today, I added a new Update
Info section to this page. It basically explains what a movie file
on IWOW needs to have in order to be classified as draft, release, or
final.</font></font>

There's not too much to report today, except this morning's completion
of the first release version of Scene 6 of Config
File Setup, and a slight design change of the Sniper in Scene 2. This
leaves me about seven weeks to get the other two tasks of Tier 8
finished.
That is all.</font></font>

finally
be converting the model of my alter-ego's adopted elfin daughter,
Brandy

it'll be a make the task a lot easier. I've extended the allotted time
on my BJQ2T

7 has come to an end, now that I've completed and published the concept
sketches of the CFS Scene 2 sniper. Now, with many of the crucial parts
of the episode finished, I've decided to slow down the pace of the
project
so I can work on other things, primarily the Brandy Hothiegh Quake2 PPM
I plan to release to <a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycount</a>
in a couple of months. In order to make absolutely sure that it's
possible
for me to finish Tier 8 on time, I'm giving myself a month and a half
to
finish it.</font></font>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ffccff">12/20/2K (Follycount) -</font><font color="#cc66cc"> For
the past few days, I've really been busy, primarily because of the
December
19th deadline on BJQ2T as my 2D Computer Animation 2 project. I managed
to get Version 1.1 of the first three scenes of Config
File Setup, and Version 0.1 of Scene 4 to videotape, and present it
to the class. My presentation wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it
would
be, and I feel I could have shown a better version of my work if I was
given the time. The voice-overs for Scenes 5 though 7 are now
completed,
and yesterday I made the release version of Scene 5 available to the
public.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; Because of the
short length
of Tier 7, and considering the work that's left in the tier, I've
decided
to extend the deadline of the tier to this Christmas. That should be
enough
time to get Tier 7's fourth and final task out of the way. You may have
noticed the new button at the bottom of this page. This is because I've
started a new References
section of the BJQ2T pages. This new page will contain certain lists
and
charts mentioned in the show. Giving these lists and charts their own
page
will make the show move along a lot faster than if they were included
in
the movies. Also added is a Credits section, one of which will be
included
in every episode main page, along with Drafts and Script.</font></font>
</p>

<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; I apologize for
keeping
you in the dark for so long about the updates, but as I said, this
project
has kept me very busy. That and my job at <a href="http://www.lordandtaylor.com/" target="_top">Lord and Taylor</a>.</font></font></p>
