tier. Compared to the last two tiers, Tier 3 shouldn't be too much of a
problem. Config File Setup will be the first movie of the project, and
my biggest obstacle now is finding someone to play the voice of Brandy.</font></font>

-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">It's near the
end of Tier 2, and I've decided to make a last minute change to my schedule.
Tier 3 will revolve around the development of first version of my first
movie in the tactical guide. It will focus on config files, what they are,
and the method I use to write them. Because of the trouble I've been having
on the Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage VWEP, and because of the new direction
I'm taking the project, I will suspend the development of the VWEP.</font></font>

like I'm a little behind on this project. Sometimes, it's amazing how fast
a commanding lead over your schedule can dissolve before your eyes.&nbsp;
I spent the past few days busting my ass on a project for school, but now
that the semester is over, I can finally move on to what's really important.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">6/4/2K (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">A few days
ago, I began work on a new project. In an effort to eventually work up
the will to begin future projects on my Into the Fray Universe, I've decided
to start an Internet series of a different kind. It will be a strategic
and tactical guide to Quake2, aptly named Brandy and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics.
The show will consist of several Quicktime movies, and will cover everything
from rocket jumping to setting up config files. This new project should
be easier that ITF:HON for two reasons. First of all, I'll require far
less help than I did for ITF:HON. I will need someone to play the voice
of Brandy Hothiegh, but other than that and some occasional advice on a
few things, I'll going to be just fine. Second, I'm giving myself ample
time to finish the project, a month for each tier to be exact. Even with
school and the possibility of getting a new job, I should be able to finish
the tiers on time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> The BJQ2T project
will consist of five one month-long tiers, each consisting of a certain
number of tasks. Much like the ITF:HON project, the tasks in each tier
will remain in place until completed or until the tier is finished. If
time on any given tier expires, its tasks will carry over to the next tier,
and must be completed in addition to the tasks that tier. If a tier is
completed significantly early, I'll give myself a day or two off from the
project, then begin the next tier with its original deadline still in place.
In other words, I'll have even more time to work on each task of that tier,
and will be way ahead of schedule. If I complete all five tiers, I will
take start to take it easy on BJQ2T, and work on it without any further
official scheduling.</font></font>

into Tony's washed-out skin in OpenGL mode.</font></font>

judging for the Cutedoll contest I entered happened last night, and went
as well as any of us could have hoped. In all, there were 31 entries, and
they were judged on two chat rooms, one for the judges, the other for the
public. When Tony came up, he was described as looking scary, and the meshing
error in his crotch made him look like he had female genitalia. Here is
what the judges said about my model on their chat room...</font></font>

me was that there were accually two other An American Tail models, Tiger
and Tanya Mousekewitz. In the end, the Hello Kitty entry took the top prize.
I didn't win the contest, but I did come across some interesting models,
and simply had fun. And that's all I could have asked out of it.</font></font>

Its been less than 24 hours since I last updated IWOW, and already the
Tony model is upgraded to Beta Version 0.2. I fixed a problem with Tony's
machinegun and hyperblaster weapon models. There used to be a strange black
spot which appeared on the weapons in OpenGL mode, but with the help of
Fafner and SocialNemises at Polycount, I managed to fix the error.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">3/29/2K (PPMs) -</font><font color="#CC66CC">
I sent in the latest version of my Tony model on the 21st of this month.
As it turns out, the deadline of the contest was the 20th of March, not
February. Anyways, my entry is in, and the first beta version of the Tony
Toponi Quake2 PPM is now available on this site. His VWEP is only partially
completed, consisting of only 8 out of 12 weapon models. Sometime in the
future, I plan to model the 4 remaining weapons, and animate some of them
as well. Once this is done, I'll upgrade Tony to Version 1.1, which will
be the post-beta version of the model.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> In case you haven't
noticed, the Future Models section of this page is gone. This is because
I am planning to devote the rest of the year to my Internet show, Into
the Fray: Hour of Need. Other than an occasional update to the Tony model,
don't expect any further updates to this page for a while, at least for
a few months. If you're ever curious about how the show is going, I'll
keep you posted in the Into the Fray&nbsp; / Internet Show section, one
which I plan to open in the near future.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">2/11/2K (PPMs) -</font><font color="#CC66CC">
As of today, I am participating in modeling contest against the best in
the biz. The contest has a 1,000 polygon limit, and the winner will be
whoever can make the best cutesy-style PPM. Although I consider such models
to be my strong suit, my relative inexperience to my competitors makes
me the underdog in this contest. The best part about this contest is that
Paul Steed himself will also be competing. The model I chose to do is one
of Tony Toponi from An American Tail. I was going to do Fievel, but I chose
against him because of his hard-to-model oversized clothing. The models
are due on the 20th of this month. Wish me luck. :)</font></font>
