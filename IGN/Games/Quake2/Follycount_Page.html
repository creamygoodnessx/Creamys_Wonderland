<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF8080">> Welcome to Follycount,
my personal parody of the <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
community and the Quake trilogy in general. Follycount will be an animated
Internet series that will depict the Internet as a vast virtual reality
world, where people get sucked into their monitors when they go online,
and where plugin player models come to life upon creation and are self-aware.
The story focuses around six clans, each resembling its own nation within
the VR Internet, and each with its own virtual reality chat room and game
servers. Follycount will consist of short episodes of various types, some
of them chat room conversations on various topics, such as rocket vs. rail,
dealing with campers, and what the Quake3 gladiators do in their spare
time. There will also be a few trailers, such as a Capture the Flag parody
of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, and parody of a Pentium III
commercial, where three people find creative ways to paint a giant Quake2
symbol on the floor with blood. And last but not least, I'll try to bring
back <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">BJQ2T</a>
in a new and improved form.</font></font>

It may be hard to believe, but it's been exactly one year since I paid
any attention to this section of my site. During this time, I've been focusing
on the development of Evil Blood, as well as taking care of my academic
needs at Bergen. My primary problem with developing Follycount is that
I've never been satisfied with its characters. It's not easy for me to
achieve a cast with a balance of personalities of people I know in real
life, and stereotypical characters on the Internet, not to mention deciding
what to do with what's left of Brandy and Jatoten. I already have a few
story ideas in mind, but without a cast of characters, there's just not
much I can do with them. That's why I've decided to officially suspend
the Follycount project, at least until I can come up with some decent characters.
I've also taken down the characters page, and it will remain unavailable
until the cast is fully re-assembled. When I eventually do get Follycount
up and running again, I'll make damn sure it was well worth the wait. Trust
me.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">10/2/2001 - There have
been some critical changes to the Follycount series. Rather than have the
series revolve around a single virtual chat room, I've decided to follow
a theme that resembles my old </font><font color="#FF8080"><a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Games/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page.html">BJQ2T</a></font><font color="#993366">
project. Now, Follycount will be just one of six Quake clans the story
of Follycount covers, and some of the characters Clan Follycount have been
relocated to these other clans. I'm also bringing back a few of my old
characters from the old BJQ2T. In addition, I've made a few changes to
the descriptions of some of the characters, and eliminated a few characters
as well. As for the minor changes, I've fixed a few wayward links in the
BJQ2T section.</font></font>
