-</font><font color="#CC66CC"> I'm almost ready to begin actively working
on Follycount as an Internet series, but first, there is one thing I have
to take care of before that happens. The first Follycount movie I plan
on making will be one of my trailers, although I haven't yet decided on
exactly which one I'll be working on. Whichever one it ends up being, I'll
have to come up with a detailed script for it, much like the one for Config
File Setup. Once the script is done, Tier 1 of Follycount will commence,
officially getting this damn thing off the ground.</font></font>

tier of the BJQ2T project drew to a close today. Even though I'm three
days late on finishing the tier, I'm still glad that it's now behind me.
During today's earliest hours, after busting my ass for about a month and
a half, I finished the first draft version of the second part of Scene
4 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>. Unfortunately, I had no time left over in this tier for
modeling the sniper's head. Oh well, there's always Tier 9 for that.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">1/9/2001 (Follycount)
- </font><font color="#CC66CC">Today, I finished the first release version
of Scene 7 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>. It's not part of the Tier 8 lineup, but it's something
I consider to be 'extra credit', so I won't be stuck with it in a future
tier. Also today, I added a new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T/Update_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Update
Info</a> section to this page. It basically explains what a movie file
on IWOW needs to have in order to be classified as draft, release, or final.</font></font>

this morning's completion of the first release version of Scene 6 of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>, and a slight design change of the Sniper in Scene 2. This
leaves me about seven weeks to get the other two tasks of Tier 8 finished.
That is all.</font></font>

It's been over eight months since I built a plugin player model for Quake2,
and frankly, I can't wait to get back into it. This time around, I'll finally
be converting the model of my alter-ego's adopted elfin daughter, Brandy
Hothiegh, into the Quake2 format. Since the mesh is already completed,
it'll be a make the task a lot easier. I've extended the allotted time
on my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">BJQ2T</a>
project in order to make some time for me to bring Brandy into the world
of Quake2.</font></font>

Scene 2 sniper. Now, with many of the crucial parts of the episode finished,
I've decided to slow down the pace of the project so I can work on other
things, primarily the Brandy Hothiegh Quake2 PPM I plan to release to <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
in a couple of months. In order to make absolutely sure that it's possible
for me to finish Tier 8 on time, I'm giving myself a month and a half to
finish it.</font></font>

-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">For the past
few days, I've really been busy, primarily because of the December 19th
deadline on BJQ2T as my 2D Computer Animation 2 project. I managed to get
Version 1.1 of the first three scenes of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>, and Version 0.1 of Scene 4 to videotape, and present it
to the class. My presentation wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would
be, and I feel I could have shown a better version of my work if I was
given the time. The voice-overs for Scenes 5 though 7 are now completed,
and yesterday I made the release version of Scene 5 available to the public.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> Because of the short
length of Tier 7, and considering the work that's left in the tier, I've
decided to extend the deadline of the tier to this Christmas. That should
be enough time to get Tier 7's fourth and final task out of the way. You
may have noticed the new button at the bottom of this page. This is because
I've started a new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T/ConfigList_Page.html">References</a>
section of the BJQ2T pages. This new page will contain certain lists and
charts mentioned in the show. Giving these lists and charts their own page
will make the show move along a lot faster than if they were included in
the movies. Also added is a Credits section, one of which will be included
in every episode main page, along with Drafts and Script.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> I apologize for keeping
you in the dark for so long about the updates, but as I said, this project
has kept me very busy. That and my job at Lord and Taylor.</font></font>
