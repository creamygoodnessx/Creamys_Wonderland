thought of
as a pre-teen Fox Moulder from Jhonen Vasquez's <a href="http://www.roomwithamoose.com/" target="_top">Invader
Zim</a>. He has an obsession for the paranormal, and is a member
of a
secret
club of fellow paranormal investigators called the the Swollen Eyeball.
He has no friends whatsoever, and noone takes him or his work
seriously,
not even his father, Professor Membrane, or his sister, Gaz. Dib is the
mortal enemy of Zim, a hostile alien of the Irken race, who has come to
Earth to enslave its people, and is disguised as a human boy. Dib is
the
only person to know Zim's true identity and his mission, but is unable
to convince anyone else of the truth.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ff8080">&gt;
Invader Zim is
one of
my favorite shows on TV, and is a very popular show amongst teens and
young
adults. Frankly, I'm surprised noone has ever released a Quake model of
one of the show's characters before now. (I've seen two Gir models, one
of Gaz, and one incompleted model of Zim, but none of them were made
into
gaming models.) This model is my way of paying homage to the show, and
I hope other models from the show will eventually follow. Some time
ago,
I did a poll on CW's front page of what cartoon character the people
would
want to see as a Quake2 PPM, and Dib won. I may make a Quake3 version
of
this model if I find the time. When Dib is completed, he will use my
universal
one-handed VWEP, the same one <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Chuckie_PPM.html">Chuckie
Finster</a> uses.</font></font> </p>
<hr width="100%">

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#ffccff">7/1/2007 -</font><font color="#cc66cc"> Nearly three
years ago, I completed the first release version of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib
Quake2 PPM</a>. The modeI was choc full of errors, and I was
never
completely happy with, so I promised myself that someday I would
improve the model. Over the past month or so, I've replaced Dib's </font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">right
hand with a permanent
fist, and this improved the model in three ways. </font></font><br>
<font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc"><br>
1 - The right hand had what looked like an extra polygon. Removing the
poly resulted in a hole in the hand that appeared in certain frames,
because in those frames, the poly appeared legit. With the hand now a
permanent fist, this anomaly is now gone.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">2 - Dib's polycount has been reduced by 64
polygons,
bringing the </font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">polycount
down from 968 to 904. I was shooting for something under 900, but I'll
take what I can get.<br>
<br>
</font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc">3 - The
fist's simplicity allowed me to add a full VWEP that that doesn't
distort too badly. The blaster that was Dib's lone weapon barely fit in
the old hand, but the new fist allows the weapons to not only distort
less, but be larger without unnaturally clipping outside the hand.<br>
</font></font></p>

<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(153, 51, 102);"><font face="SpaceOne">10/22/2004 -
After over a year and a half of on and off work, Version 1.1 of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">my
Dib PPM</a> is finally complete! However, I'm not completely
satisfied
with how it turned out. I couldn't apply the VWEP to Dib without the
weapon
distorting as it animated, so I decided to leave it out of this
particular
build. However, the model does include a full soundpack, and two
capture
the flag skins.<br>
<br>
</font></div>
</center>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(153, 51, 102);"><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; The soundpack
gave me
an incredibly hard time. I thought I could use the <a href="http://www.roomwithamoose.com/" target="_top">Invader
Zim</a> episodes I downloaded with <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/kazaalite/" target="_top">KaZaA
Lite</a> to make wave files, but <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiereel/main.html" target="_top">Adobe
Premiere</a> rejected the <a href="http://www.divx.com/" target="_top">DivX</a>
codec, so that option was out. I then thought about using the episodes
of IZ I had recorded on videotape, but my sister was borrowing it at
the
time. She finally returned the tape yestedrday, so I was able to work
on
the soundpack today. However, the tape didn't provide enough samples to
make a complete soundpack, but then I thought of an option I couldn't
think
of earlier in the week when I found the Sound Recorder wouldn't record
sounds for locally played AVI / MPG files. I brought my laptop <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Glamdring.jpg">Glamdring</a>
into my bedroom, and hooked up its audio out port to my main computer <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/CES_Log/Photo_Log/CES_Log01/Creamy&amp;Candybox02.jpg">Candybox</a>'s
line in port. I then transfered some episodes of IZ from Candybox to
Glamdring
to avoid lag. Then, as I played the IZ episodes on Glamdring, I was
able
to record the audio samples on Candybox. I managed to find all of the
sounds
I needed to complete Dib's soundpack, except the gurp and drown sounds.
The volume of the samples varied from too soft to too loud. In order to
correct this, I opened the Male model's Jump1 sound, and used it for
comparison
as I adjusted the volume of Dib's samples.<br>
<br>
</font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(153, 51, 102);"><font face="SpaceOne">&gt; For the next
version of
the Dib, I plan to replace the right hand with a permanent fist. This
will
solve a lot of problems I've been having with the model. The
replacement
wound lower Dib's poly count, hopefully below 900. Also, there is a
seemingly
wasted polygon within the hand that only shows up during certain
frames;
something I've never seen before in any of my other models. And most
importantly,
a solid fist may be kinder to the VWEPs than a normal hand, and may
reduce
the distorting of the weapon models. Since Dib holds a weapon in his
right
hand for most of the 198 frames, the replacement won't make much of a
difference
to anyone who sees the model in action. Of course, I will have to redo
the skinmap for that part of the model.</font></div>

animations completed, except
for
Crouch
Walk. I wanted to have Dib crawl on his belly like an Army private
crawling
under a low wire, but I couldn't find the right animation reference to
follow. I finally found a few potential references while looking over
some
old tapes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold%21" target="_top">Hey
Arnold</a> episodes a week ago. Using one of these references, I
found
a crawl which was almost as good as the belly crawl I originally
wanted,
and decided to settle for it. The resulting animation is the
reference's
crawl with my own personal touch to it. The short clip below shows the
completed Crouch Walk, but the actual CW is far less choppy than the
clip
suggests.</font></font> </p>

With the
completion of
Crouch Walk, I was finally able to compile all of Dib's animations into
a choreography. I found an extra frame with the Flipoff and Crouch
Death
animations, but other than that the compiling went smoothly. This puts
me at the start of the optimization phase of this project, which I will
start soon. As I do Dib's optimizations, I will turn to some ancient
notes

When I was doing
the Crouch
Attack, it dawned on me that since Dib fires his weapon with one hand
while
crouching, there would be more of a recoil from this attack than in his
standard standing attack, where he holds the weapon with two hands. I
took
another look at Dib's Attack animation, and noticed a violent recoil
that
almost caused Dib to fall backwards. Then I realized that the recoil in
Dib's Crouch Attack couldn't exceed the explosive recoil in his
standing
attack. So I thought it would make sense to redo the standing attack,
significantly
reducing its recoil so that it was less than that of Crouch Attack.
Besides,
I thought it might be a good idea to show that Dib is comfortable in
firing
his weapon.</font></font> </p>

- This is an
update
that should have been made yesterday when I first announced it on the
front
page, but somehow I just forgot to put it up here; don't ask. Anyways,
since the last update, I completed three new animations for </font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#cc66cc"><a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Dib_PPM.html">Dib</a></font></font><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">; Taunt,
Point, and Wave. This brings the total number of completed animation to
twelve out of twenty. While Taunt and Point were only moderately
difficult,
the Wave was an absolute bitch.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">&gt;
Like I did with
my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Chuckie_PPM.html">Chuckie</a>
and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony</a>
models, I'm dedicating Dib's wave to his grenade toss. At first, I
planned
on having the toss take the form of a baseball pitch, but after I
finished
the first keyframe, I decided to change it to what Brandy Oteigh was
going
to use for her own grenade toss. Dib's Hand Grenade model is Brandy's
ballflinger,
a throwing device I saw on an episode of <a href="http://disney.go.com/index" target="_top">Disney's</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">_</span><a href="http://psc.disney.go.com/abcnetworks/toondisney/shows/weekenders/" target="_top">The
Weekenders</a>. I used a clip from the show as a reference, and
it was
tough to work with, since it only gave me two dimensions to study
instead
of three, so I had to resort a lot of guesswork. Below is the reference
clip from The Weekenders next to Dib's finished Grenade Toss animation.</font></font>

I realized
something important
when I was putting together the clip of Dib's Grenade Toss. I noticed
the
flinger was upside-down while he was holding it in his default Stand
frame.
At first I thought it was a problem with the constraints that bind the
flinger model to Dib, but then I noticed the Dib's right hand was
turned
the wrong way, so that the back of his hand faces the front. This could
mean that I have to adjust all the animations I've made so far to
correct
this problem. So what I'll do for CW's next update is make a
choreography
with all of Dib's animations, where he holds the flinger in his right
hand.
Needless to say, this will hold me back quite a bit, but I'm still
making
my final preparations for this year's <a href="http://www.quakecon.org" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>,
so it might take me a while to make it happen.</font></font>

were

the polycount came out to be 1029 polygons. Here's the result of all my

I reworked Dib's
torso
in order to make it more SmartSkin friendly. At the middle of the
torso,
the mesh now branches off into two parts; the belly, and the shirt.
This
upgrade allows Dib to raise his legs without them clipping through the
shirt. Trust me, this was more of a bitch than you think. The top four
pics show what the torso was like before the upgrade, the bottom is
after.</font></font></div>

I've applied
Dib's eye
movement to his existing animations, and will apply them to all of his
future animations as well. The eyes came out far better than I
initially
expected, and I think they're very true to Dib. I've described in
detail
how I created these eye movements in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Model_Tut/Mesh&amp;Bones_Page.html">Mesh
&amp; Bones</a> section of my <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tutorial_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2
PPM modelling tutorial</a>. I only finished one new animation
since my
last
update, the Salute. Killing two birds with one stone, here's a short
animation
demonstrating Dib's Salute complete with the eye movements.</font></font>

mesh and skeleton four days ago. I spent about 13 solid hours over a
two
day period on the body (everything except the head) and skeleton,
forsaking
sleep, food, and bodily hygene to do so. The model sheet I used as my
rotoscope
cheated a bit, so I had to make a few comprimises. My version of Dib
isn't
exactly "on model", but I'm happy with it anyway. The model's final
patch
count came out to be 587 patches, which I hope will translate to less
than
900 polygons when I export it to <a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/3dsmax/" target="_top">3DS
Max</a>.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="SpaceOne"><font color="#993366">&gt;&nbsp;
I've
included two
avi files with this update; one is the standard idle spin, while the
other
is a sample of what Dib's Run looks like so far. The run is one of the
seven animations I've completed so far. I held off animating the eyes,
because I had forgotten that my current version of <a href="http://www.hash.com/" target="_top">Animation
Master</a> (AM2000, v8.0) supported SmartSkin. Now that it's come
back
to me, I'll do the eyes as soon as I get a chance.</font></font>

as the result of two
back-to-back
sleepless night cramathons. The hair was by far the toughest feature to
model, and I had to spend at least three solid hours studying his
complex
hairstyle on several screenshots of IZ before laying down the first
spline.
When this model is finished, the giant lock of hair, the eyes, and the
mouth will be animated. So far, the head weighs in at 210 patches. I've
included a small avi of Dib's head spinning, as well as a shot of the
top
of his head.</font></font> </p>

This is accually the second
time I've modelled the head. The original head model was lost when BOTH
of Candybox's hard drives terminally failed within hours of each other
late last December. As a result, I've had to rebuild the head by
tracing
screenshots I took of the model and pimped at <a href="http://polycount.com/" target="_top">Polycount</a>.
I plan on modelling the hair next, followed by the rest of the features
of the head.</font></font> </p>
