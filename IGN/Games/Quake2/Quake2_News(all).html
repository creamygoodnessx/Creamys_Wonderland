<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">10/2/2002 (Follycount)
-</font><font color="#CC66CC"> I have decided to abort the BJQ2T project,
and focus on developing the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Follycount_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Follycount</a>
series instead. However, BJQ2T was not a total waste, as there is a lot
from this project I can salvage for use Follycount. I've re-aranged this
page so that it focuses on the Config File Setup episode of BJQ2T, rather
than remaining open for any future development. I don't know how this page
is going to turn out in the future, but it's a safe bet that this will
not be its final overhaul.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> It may be hard to
believe, but it's been exactly one year since I paid any attention to this
section of my site. During this time, I've been focusing on the development
of Evil Blood, as well as taking care of my academic needs at Bergen. My
primary problem with developing Follycount is that I've never been satisfied
with its characters. It's not easy for me to achieve a cast with a balance
of personalities of people I know in real life, and stereotypical characters
on the Internet, not to mention deciding what to do with what's left of
Brandy and Jatoten. I already have a few story ideas in mind, but without
a cast of characters, there's just not much I can do with them. That's
why I've decided to officially suspend the Follycount project, at least
until I can come up with some decent characters. I've also taken down the
characters page, and it will remain unavailable until the cast is fully
re-assembled. When I eventually do get Follycount up and running again,
I'll make damn sure it was well worth the wait. Trust me.</font></font>

the Follycount series. Rather than have the series revolve around a single
virtual chat room, I've decided to follow a theme that resembles my old
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">BJQ2T</a>
project. Now, Follycount will be just one of six Quake clans the story
of Follycount covers, and some of the characters Clan Follycount have been
relocated to these other clans. I'm also bringing back a few of my old
characters from the old BJQ2T. In addition, I've made a few changes to
the descriptions of some of the characters, and eliminated a few characters
as well. As for the minor changes, I've fixed a few wayward links in the
BJQ2T section.</font></font>

on Follycount as an Internet series, but first, there is one thing I have
to take care of before that happens. The first Follycount movie I plan
on making will be one of my trailers, although I haven't yet decided on
exactly which one I'll be working on. Whichever one it ends up being, I'll
have to come up with a detailed script for it, much like the one for Config
File Setup. Once the script is done, Tier 1 of Follycount will commence,
officially getting this damn thing off the ground.</font></font>

few days, I've really been busy, primarily because of the December 19th
deadline on BJQ2T as my 2D Computer Animation 2 project. I managed to get
Version 1.1 of the first three scenes of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T_Page(fs).html" target="_top">Config
File Setup</a>, and Version 0.1 of Scene 4 to videotape, and present it
to the class. My presentation wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped it would
be, and I feel I could have shown a better version of my work if I was
given the time. The voice-overs for Scenes 5 though 7 are now completed,
and yesterday I made the release version of Scene 5 available to the public.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> Because of the short
length of Tier 7, and considering the work that's left in the tier, I've
decided to extend the deadline of the tier to this Christmas. That should
be enough time to get Tier 7's fourth and final task out of the way. You
may have noticed the new button at the bottom of this page. This is because
I've started a new <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/BJQ2T/ConfigList_Page.html">References</a>
section of the BJQ2T pages. This new page will contain certain lists and
charts mentioned in the show. Giving these lists and charts their own page
will make the show move along a lot faster than if they were included in
the movies. Also added is a Credits section, one of which will be included
in every episode main page, along with Drafts and Script.</font></font>

complete the entire no-frills CFS in a single tier like I've been trying
to do for the past two tiers, I'll try to focus on one scene of the episode
per tier. This may be a wise decision since Scene 6 of CFS is a seven-parter,
and the final scene of the episode involves something I've never experimented
with before. As for the other tasks in Tier 6, I plan to post a few concept
sketches of the first extra character, and do some of the voice overs for

a commanding lead over your schedule can dissolve before your eyes.&nbsp;
I spent the past few days busting my ass on a project for school, but now
that the semester is over, I can finally move on to what's really important.</font></font>

-</font><font color="#993366"> </font><font color="#CC66CC">A few days
ago, I began work on a new project. In an effort to eventually work up
the will to begin future projects on my Into the Fray Universe, I've decided
to start an Internet series of a different kind. It will be a strategic
and tactical guide to Quake2, aptly named Brandy and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics.
The show will consist of several Quicktime movies, and will cover everything
from rocket jumping to setting up config files. This new project should
be easier that ITF:HON for two reasons. First of all, I'll require far
less help than I did for ITF:HON. I will need someone to play the voice
of Brandy Hothiegh, but other than that and some occasional advice on a
few things, I'll going to be just fine. Second, I'm giving myself ample
time to finish the project, a month for each tier to be exact. Even with
school and the possibility of getting a new job, I should be able to finish
the tiers on time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> The BJQ2T project
will consist of five one month-long tiers, each consisting of a certain
number of tasks. Much like the ITF:HON project, the tasks in each tier
will remain in place until completed or until the tier is finished. If
time on any given tier expires, its tasks will carry over to the next tier,
and must be completed in addition to the tasks that tier. If a tier is
completed significantly early, I'll give myself a day or two off from the
project, then begin the next tier with its original deadline still in place.
In other words, I'll have even more time to work on each task of that tier,
and will be way ahead of schedule. If I complete all five tiers, I will
take start to take it easy on BJQ2T, and work on it without any further
official scheduling.</font></font>

73 days since I started work on my <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony
Toponi Quake2 PPM</a>, he's finished. Not only is his VWEP completed, but
his skin is also darker in order to show his eyes, which before where blended
into Tony's washed-out skin in OpenGL mode.</font></font>

After 18 days of busting my ass on a fully animated hyperblaster weapon
model, I'm proud to present Version 0.3 of the Tony Toponi PPM. This version
also includes animations for Tony's rocket launcher, but only on the attack
animations.</font></font>

judging for the Cutedoll contest I entered happened last night, and went
as well as any of us could have hoped. In all, there were 31 entries, and
they were judged on two chat rooms, one for the judges, the other for the
public. When Tony came up, he was described as looking scary, and the meshing
error in his crotch made him look like he had female genitalia. Here is
what the judges said about my model on their chat room...</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> One thing that surprised
me was that there were accually two other An American Tail models, Tiger
and Tanya Mousekewitz. In the end, the Hello Kitty entry took the top prize.
I didn't win the contest, but I did come across some interesting models,
and simply had fun. And that's all I could have asked out of it.</font></font>

Its been less than 24 hours since I last updated IWOW, and already the
Tony model is upgraded to Beta Version 0.2. I fixed a problem with Tony's
machinegun and hyperblaster weapon models. There used to be a strange black
spot which appeared on the weapons in OpenGL mode, but with the help of
Fafner and SocialNemises at Polycount, I managed to fix the error.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">3/29/2K (PPMs) -</font><font color="#CC66CC">
I sent in the latest version of my Tony model on the 21st of this month.
As it turns out, the deadline of the contest was the 20th of March, not
February. Anyways, my entry is in, and the first beta version of the Tony
Toponi Quake2 PPM is now available on this site. His VWEP is only partially
completed, consisting of only 8 out of 12 weapon models. Sometime in the
future, I plan to model the 4 remaining weapons, and animate some of them
as well. Once this is done, I'll upgrade Tony to Version 1.1, which will
be the post-beta version of the model.</font></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#CC66CC">> In case you haven't
noticed, the Future Models section of this page is gone. This is because
I am planning to devote the rest of the year to my Internet show, Into
the Fray: Hour of Need. Other than an occasional update to the Tony model,
don't expect any further updates to this page for a while, at least for
a few months. If you're ever curious about how the show is going, I'll
keep you posted in the Into the Fray&nbsp; / Internet Show section, one
which I plan to open in the near future.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FFCCFF">2/11/2K (PPMs) -</font><font color="#CC66CC">
As of today, I am participating in modeling contest against the best in
the biz. The contest has a 1,000 polygon limit, and the winner will be
whoever can make the best cutesy-style PPM. Although I consider such models
to be my strong suit, my relative inexperience to my competitors makes
me the underdog in this contest. The best part about this contest is that
Paul Steed himself will also be competing. The model I chose to do is one
of Tony Toponi from An American Tail. I was going to do Fievel, but I chose
against him because of his hard-to-model oversized clothing. The models
are due on the 20th of this month. Wish me luck. :)</font></font>
