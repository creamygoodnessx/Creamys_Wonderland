<p><font color="#FF8080">> I became interested in the art of modeling Quake
2 plugin player models (PPMs) when I first visited the Q2PMP in the middle
of 1998. From that moment, I became a PPM junkie, collecting good, high
quality models wherever I could find them. I always wanted to get into
PPM modeling myself, and had a few ideas from a few of my interests in
other genres, but lacked the tools and know-how to do so. It was the middle
of the July of 1999 when I got my first real break. After almost a year
of searching for the right tutorials and software, I was finally ready
to start my first model, Chuckie Finster.</font>

<p><font color="#FFCCFF">3/20/2003 -</font><font color="#CC66CC"> From
this point forward, I will post all Quake PPM works in progress on this
page, so that you can see the progress I'm making with each one. There
are two models for Quake2 I'm currently working on. <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Creamy_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Creamy
Goodness</a>, formerly known as Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage, is a model
I completed quite a while back, but only now am I finding the time to put
it into a game environment. If the updates on the model's page look familiar,
that's because CG was part of two projects I was doing a while back. After
I finish CG as a Quake model, I probably won't do any more major work on
it.</font>
<p><font color="#CC66CC">> Over a year and a half ago, I did a poll on
the front page of Creamy's Wonderland, asking what cartoon character you
would like to see as a Quake2 or Quake3 model. The winner of that poll
was <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Quake2/Dib_PPM(fs).html" target="_top">Dib</a>,
and I'm sure that most people who visit this site regularly (all 12 of
you) were starting to doubt if I'd ever get around to getting Dib into
the arenas. Well, as it turns out, I finally had the chance to do just
that, and you can now see the model as it gets built step by step.</font>

<p><font color="#993366">4/28/2001 - Due to some recent popular demand,
I've decided to work on converting my Jatoten Rascot Battle Mage model
to Quake2, rather than doing so with Brandy. To tell you the truth, this
'popular demand' comes in the form of fellow Polycounter Frankie, but that's
good enough for me. (That's right Frankie, I haven't forgotten about you.)</font>
