<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; During the <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
of 2003, I came across a strange but interesting game while walking to
my laptop, which I had brought for the BYOC. This game was not played
with
keyboards or standard joysticks, but instead with large <a href="http://www.redoctane.com/ddr.html" target="_top">dance
pads</a> with four arrows on it (left, down, up, and right). The game
was
being <a href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/Games/Quake2/QuakeCon/Pics/QCon2003/DDR02.jpg">projected
on a big screen</a> at the front of the room near the podium, and on
the
screen were two sets of four transparant arrows (left, down, up, and
right)
lined up horizontally near the top of the screen. Several flashing
arrows
scrolled up from the bottom of the screen, and when they met their
counterpart
arrows on top, the players would step on the matching arrow on their
dance
pad. The game was called <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/stepmania/" target="_top">Stepmania</a>,
a free downloadable clone of a similiar arcade game called <a href="http://www.ddrfreak.com/" target="_top">Dance
Dance Revolution</a>. I did try it out a couple of times but just
couldn't
get into it that much. However, several months after the QuakeCon, I
was
visiting my cousin Stephanie in south Florida, and she had Stepmania on
her machine, along with a dance pad. It was then when I decided to give
the game another try, so Stephanie game me a CD with several song packs
on it, and when I eventually got back home in New Jersey, I downloaded
Stepmania and tried out on my computer. After playing the songs on
Stephanie's
CD on my keyboards, I became more interested in the game, and several
years
later, I began writing steps of my own for some of my favorite songs.
If
all goes as planned, I'll be able to afford a metal dance pad in a few
months time, and only then will I get to experience Stepmania in full.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="+1"><a href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/Games/Stepmania/Songpacks_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Songpacks</a></font>
- One of the best features that Stepmania has to offer is its stepfile
editor, which allows you to create your own steps for song files, and
to
edit existing songs files. Inspired by custom songpacks such as
BemaniRuler
Originals and the <a href="http://www.gamecast.org/plaguemix/" target="_top">PlagueMix
Series</a>, I decided to start making a few of my own stepfiles.</font></p>
