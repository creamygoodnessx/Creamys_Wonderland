It's
been over a month since IWOW's last update, but I've gotten quite a few
things done since then. The one section I gave the most attention to
this
time around was <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer's
character page</a> in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. I put up a couple more sketches of her, as well as
suggest
an alternate plot for her in her spoiler page. I've also posted <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune's</a>
height and details drawing on his character page. Speaking of character
pages, I came up with my own variation of a famous set of steps for
cartoon
animators to create animated characters, which is now available on the
main Evil Blood <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Characters_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">character
page</a>.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">&gt; If
you take
a quick peek around the site, you'll notice that some of the ad banners
have been fixed. They went AWOL several months ago, but I never could
figure
out exactly why. I'll fix the rest of them on IWOW's next update.&nbsp;
In the poll on this page, I've decided to replace Pico with Stewy
Griffin
from the Seth McFarlane's cartoon series Family Guy. And one more
thing.
I'm almost ready to officially start work on the Follycount
project. All I need to do is finish writing a script for one of the
show's
trailers and I'll be good to go.</font></font></font>

Today,
after putting my mind on overdrive for many laborous hours, I managed
to
fix a small issue I've been having in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
spoiler in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. I've also added my first front and profile head
sketches
of Dust to his page. A couple days ago, I repaired the link to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Models/Jatoten_Rascot/Movies/Animation_Tests/JRa_-_Sharpie_Circle.avi">Magic
Sharpie</a> test animation on King Creamy's Follycount
bio.</font></font></font>

On the 18th, right after I updated IWOW for the 17th, I began updating
the info of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> characters <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune</a>
and the Plant Queen. I also put up a first draft pic of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer</a>
on her info page. As for Follycount,
I updated a few of the characters' profiles, as well as add a draft pic
for vogue13, Soul Ripper, and the Shining.</font></font></font>

Yep, another upgrade already. I know I said that I'd change the poll
every
on major update, but obviously I've gotta give it more than a day,
right?
I finally got around to making the spoilers for <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> characters <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune</a>,
Dust, and <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer</a>
available. Just a word of warning, though. As many of you know,
spoilers
are bits of information about a story that can give away the story, so
don't read the spoilers if you want to wait for me to release the comic
to find out what happens. I have also updated the info on Stardancer
and
the Plant Queen.</font></font></font>

I've finally gotten around to doing something for IWOW that I've wanted
to do for a long time. I have added a counter to the front page, but I
plan to replace it with something better looking in the future. Also,
I've
added a new polling system where the question will change on every
major
site upgrade. Seeing how I haven't been upgrading the site too
frequently
lately, each poll will have plenty of time to rack up votes.</font></font></font>

It's been about a month since my last update, but after you see what
I've
been doing for IWOW in all this time,&nbsp; I think you'll agree that
the
wait was well worth it. I have basically dismantled the Hour of Need
story,
and replaced it with a new and improved storyline called <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>. Since my Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics project was partially based on HON, I
renovated that as well, replacing it with Follycount,
a comedic parody of the <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
community. If my current plans remain in-tact, the old BJQ2T will be
part
of Follycount, with its story altered to eliminate its ties with HON.</font></font></font>

A few days ago, I finished a quick and dirty storyboard of Scene 4-3 of
BJQ2T:CFS.
There's also a new short movie on my alter ego's profile page for your
viewing pleasure. Also, from now until further notice, I will be
focusing
my efforts on completely finishing Scene 4 of BJQ2T:CFS.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">&gt; I
will soon
be tearing down the ENTIRE <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Into
the Fray</a> section of IWOW, in order to make way for my new Evil
Blood
online comic project. This will effect the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
section of this site, because of the ties that BJQ2T shares with ITF.
Severing
these ties and making new ones to accommodate the new story won't be
easy,
and I expect it to take several months for me to finish this critical
transition.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">3/23/2001

I put up a new BJQ2T Models section in the Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics section of IWOW. Within this newpage
are
the profiles for two new characters, Red Storm and dDuck.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">3/10/2001

After about two weeks of frustrating hard work, I've gotten the head of
the sniper in Scene 2 of BJQ2T:CFS
finished. That is all.</font></font></font>

Um, okeydoke. It's been well over a month since my last upgrade to
IWOW,
and during this time, I've been juggling my time between IWOW, school,
and TV. In all of this chaos, I somehow managed to finish Scene 4-2 of
Config
File Setup of Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics. I've also started Tier 9 of the BJQ2T
project.</font></font></font>
