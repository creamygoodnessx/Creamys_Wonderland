Here's another late update in the series, effectively ending my 'one
upgrade
every four days' plan. But what matters is that it's here, so who the
hell
cares? In this fifth upgrade of the series, I have updated <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune's</a>
character profile due to the information on the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Deities&amp;Magic_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Deities
and Magic</a> page. I've also eliminated Oinkillune's spoiler, since
the
information it once contained will now be revealed at the beginning of
the story, and therefore will no longer ruin the plot. I don't know
when
I'm going to finish the sixth and final upgrade, but I can give you an
idea of what to expect. First of all, this site will no longer be known
as the Infinite World of Wonder, but something with a lot fewer
syllables.
I will introduce a new character to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a>, and eliminate one who longer has a clear purpose in the
story.
Also, the entire site will undergo a total cosmetic makeover, making it
easier to navigate, and truer to the subject matters of each section.
Finally,
there will be a new front-page mural, one that I've been designing for
many weeks, but haven't actually started drawing yet. There will be a
few
other changes as well, but they're too many to list here, so I guess I
have no choice but to leave you all to wonder. Muahahahaha!</font></font></font>

Due to certain distractions in my real life, I was forced to skip the
upgrade
for the 16th. Anyways, this is still considered to be the forth upgrade
in this series, and a rather significant one at that. All of the
upgrades
tonight are in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section of IWOW. There is a new <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Glossary_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Glossary</a>
page, which should make my job of explaining the different elements of
Evil Blood a little easier. While it only has five entries for now, you
can bet your ass that number will skyrocket in the future as I continue
to develop the story. I feel it's worth noting that the Glossary page
is
the first time I ever used targets in HTML. I also had a chance to
finish
updating the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/EB_Zodian_Threat%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Zodian
Threat</a> page, which happened to be a near complete overhaul.
Finally,
there are a multitude of story fixes on the recently updated pages.
That's
all for now, take it easy.</font></font></font>

And now for update number three of the series. I've finished the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Art_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">art
gallery</a> update I began four days ago, and have come up with an icon
for the page. In addition to the now finished
<a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Art_Gallery/Art_BCC_Projects%28fs%29.html" target="_top">School
Projects</a> section is the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/iwow/Art_Gallery/Art_Murals%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Murals</a>
page, which stores all of the front page murals I've put up in the
past.
In the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section of IWOW, I have begun the process of breaking the
former
Plot Page into two separate pages, as well as updating the story in the
process. A short description of the primary human threat to Nnet Olotor
is described in the new <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/EB_Alien_Invasion%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Alien
Invasion</a> page. The story behind the threat that Zod poses to Nnet
Olotor
had not yet been updated, but it can be found in its own section, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/EB_Zodian_Threat%28fs%29.html" target="_top">The
Zodian Threat</a>.</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">8/8/2002 -
The
second in a series of site updates. <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Art_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">My
art gallery</a> is now partially up and and running. Right now, I only
have one section with three pics, but I'll have the rest of it
available
on the next update.</font></font></font>

I
LIVE!!! It's been over FIVE months since I last updated IWOW, but let's
not dwell on the past, shall we? I've had so much work building up all
this time, that&nbsp; I decided it would be best if I broke it up into
several small updates. Within the next 20 days, I plan to make one
additional
update at four day intervals. As the first contribution of this series
of updates, I have created a new sub-section of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> by the name of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Deities&amp;Magic_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Deities
and Magic</a>, which explains the origins of magic and deities on Nnet
Olotor, and the connection between the two. I also wrote the first
sub-section
of D&amp;M, which is <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/DM-Mages&amp;Clerics%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Mages
and Clerics</a>. I know a lot of you have had trouble navigating
through
this site, but by the time these updates are through getting around
IWOW
should be a lot easier. I also plan on changing the look of the site,
and
am even considering a possible name change. That's all for now, and if
all goes well, I should have IWOW updated again on the eighth.</font></font></font>

WTF??? It's really been over four frickin' months since my last update?
Yeah, well better late then never, huh? Anyways, I finished three major
updates to <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood's</a> story. The first of these updates is the first spoiler of
Evil
Blood's basic plot. This was a particularly frustrating experience,
because
one I had everything written out, I lost it all when transferring the
text
via clipboard. I made the stupid mistake of copying something else to
the
clipboard before my transfer was finished. It took me two hours of
non-stop
typing to get it all back, and I don't feel it turned out nearly as
good
as the first time. :( The second update is a more detailed description
of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Oinkillune</a>,
although this sure as hell isn't its final version. The third update is
the start of a complete overhaul of Dust's character. These are only
about
half the updates I had in mind for IWOW, so expect more within the next
couple days. <a href="mailto:jrascot@hotmail.com">Rascot</a> out.</font></font></font>

I have made a few alterations in the process of creating the design of
my characters. You can read all about it in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Characters_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Characters</a>
page of the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. In case you didn't notice already, I changed the
background
of this page, and have decided to cycle through some of the other
backgrounds
I've put up in the past, as well as putting up a few new ones. I've
also
gotten IWOW's birthday mural finished. So what if it's nine days late,
it's up now so who the hell cares?</font></font></font>

Today, my online baby, The Infinite World of Wonder, reaches its second
birthday! I'm sorry I don't have a mural yet, but I'll try to whip one
up tomorrow. :( Anyways, the "Kissing the Public's Ass" poll is now
officially
closed, and the winner is Dib with 20 votes. Keep in mind, however,
that
I can't guarantee that I'll ever get this model completed, as I don't
have
a crystall ball to tell me what obstacles life will throw at me. As for
any real site updates, some critical changes have been made to the
Follycount
section as I suggested in five days ago. It's too much to explain on
this
page so head on down there to see for yourself. Also, <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/Bio-Stardancer%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Stardancer's</a>
height and details pic is now available for you to see in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section.</font></font></font>

I must humbly apologize for the lack of updates, and for a near two
month
wait, I don't have much to show for it. :( The only thing I really did
was fix a broken link on this page. But now for something important for
the site's regular visitors. The Infinite World of Wonder's second
anniversary
is coming up in five days on the second of October. On this day, I will
officially close the "Kissing the Public's Ass" poll and announce its
winner.
So if you haven't yet voted for who you want to see in the arenas, do
it
soon. Also, expect a few changes to the Follycount
section of the site.</font></font></font>

Well, have I an update for you tonight. I made a rather significant
update
to the Basic Plot page of IWOW's <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Evil
Blood</a> section. I've also taken the liberty of fixing the all
banners
on the site, as well as brightening the dark purple color of the old
news,
just to make things easier on your eyes. I was hoping to have the
height
and details pic and the turnaround of Stardancer finished by this
update,
but time restrictions got in the way. :( Oh well, maybe next time.</font></font></font></p>
