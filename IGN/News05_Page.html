I now have a new link in the often overlooked <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Links_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Links</a>
section of IWOW. It is the<a href="http://www.eff.org" target="_top">
Electronic
Frontier Foundation's</a> <a href="http://www.eff.org/br/" target="_top">Blue
Ribbon Campaign</a> website, something I should have put up a long,
long
time ago. In lesser news, a new test animation is available in the
BJQ2T
main page.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">1/9/2001 -
Scene
7 of Config File Setup of Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics is now behind me, and a new Update
Info section has been added to the Goodies page of BJQ2T. That is
all.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">1/7/2001 -
And
now, the fist update to IWOW of the millennium. (For those of you who
consider
2001 to be the start of the millennium rather than 2000, that is.) The
sixth scene of&nbsp; the Config File Setup episode of BJQ2T
is now available in its release form. Also, I've made a slight change
to
the design of the sniper model.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">12/28/2K -
The
concept sketches of the sniper from the Config File Setup episode of
BJQ2T
are now completed. With this task out of the way, the
seventh tier of the BJQ2T project comes to an end. I'm also
planning
on converting the Brandy Hothiegh model into a Quake2 PPM.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">12/24/2K -
This
site update is a rather minor one compared to the ones I've been doing
recently. I've taken a few screenshots of <a href="http://www.millionairetv.com/" target="_top">Who
Wants to be a Millionaire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Arnold%21" target="_top">Hey
Arnold</a>. I will use these screenshots as sources in order to help me
draw a concept sketch of the sniper from Scene 2 of the Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics episode Config File Setup.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">12/20/2K -
I've
been falling behind in my news bearing responsibilities lately. Since
my
last site update eleven days ago, a lot's been going on with my BJQ2T
project. The deadline for BJQ2T as my 2D Computer Animation project was
yesterday, and as a result of my underestimation of the project, the
only
thing I was able to hand in was the first four scenes, the first three
being their release versions, and the fourth was only the draft version
of the first part. The rest of the news is too much to list here on the
main page, but you can read all about it on the BJQ2T page.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">12/9/2K -
Scene
7 of no-frills CFS of BJQ2T
is now finished, which means that all seven scenes of the episode are
now
at least in the completed draft state. I also finished synchronizing
the
video and audio tracks of the first three scenes, promoting them to
release
level.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">12/1/2K -
Tier
7 of my BJQ2T
project has begun. I had to move back the deadline of this tier to the
19th, because that's when it's due as my 2D Computer Animation 2
homework
project.</font></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">11/29/2K -
The
Quake2/BJQ2T
section Infinite World of Wonder now has a new section, the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Archive_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">BJQ2T
news archive</a>. You can check that out, as well as further progress
on
the BJQ2T project, on the BJQ2T page.</font></font></font>
</p>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#009900"><font size="+1">11/24/2K -
Scene
6 of the no-frills version of the Config File Setup episode of Brandy
and Jatoten's Quake2 Tactics is now ready for the eyes of the
public.
I've also began recording the voice overs for the first three scenes of
BJQ2T. The new picture you see above shows the new <a href="http://www.polycount.com" target="_top">Polycount</a>
IWOW web addy.</font></font></font></p>
