<p><font color="#ff8080">6/4/2K - In the wake of my failed ITF:HON
project,
I've decided to try my hand at creating a different kind of Internet
series.
It will be an animated Quake2
tactical guide, and will cover many tactics and strategies in order
to help to introduce beginners to the game. Brandy and my Chiddetnese
alter
ego will host the show, and it's possible that parts of the show will
require
additional characters.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">5/20/2K - Today is a dark day for the Infinite
World of Wonder. After three tiers on the Into the Fray: Hour of Need
project,
I've decided its time to pull the plug on it. Check out the ITF:HON
project
page for an explanation of my decision.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">5/1/2K - With today's completion of the
Cardiano
model, I am, at last, finished with Tier 2 of my Into the Fray: Hour of
Need project. Tier 3 will definitely keep me on my toes, with three
tasks
to deal with this time.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/26/2K - The full version of ny <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony
Toponi Quake2 PPM</a> has finally been released! In addition, the
Cardiano
ITF:HON model is taking longer than expected, but I should still be
able
to finish it by the end of Tier 2. However, the first extra model will
have to wait until Tier 3 to make an appearance.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/17/2K - My <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony
Toponi Quake2 PPM</a> has been upgraded to Beta Version 0.3. Come and
get
it while it's hot!</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/16/2K - Today, I completed the head of the
Cardiano
model. And now begins Tier 2. There is also a new Conquered Tiers
section
of IWOW, which is basically ITF:HON's local news archive.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/13/2K - Yesterday afternoon, I finished my
first
ITF:HON model - Brandy Hothiegh. Although I'm a day behind on my
schedule,
the completion of this model will spearhead the start of the show.
Brandy
won't appear until the later chapters, however just knowing how to
model
using AM98 alone, gives me the confidence to get through this long and
taxing project.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/4/2K - I recently took the liberty of adding
four new icons for the Cow model in the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/SkinsIcons_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Skins
and Icons</a> page in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>.
Also, I fixed the color scheme throughout the page to their correct
colors.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ff8080">4/2/2K - The judging for the Polycount
Cutedoll
contest which I entered happened last night. Head on over to the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/PPM_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">PPMs</a>
page in <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Quake2_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Quake2</a>
to see how I did.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#ff8080">3/30/2K - I'm sure by now you've noticed
something
different about this page. As you can see from the links below, I've
added
two new sections to the Infinite World of Wonder. The <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Archive_Page%28fs%29.html" target="_top">News
Archive</a> is simply a collection of old updates to IWOW, while the
Jumpstation
will take you to any page on the sight with just a single jump. If
that's
not enough for you, I also upgraded the <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/Games/Quake2/Tony_PPM.html">Tony
Toponi PPM</a> to Beta Version 0.2. And, saving the best for last, the
Internet Show page of <a href="http://creamyg.planetquake.gamespy.com/ITF/ITF_Intro%28fs%29.html" target="_top">Into
the Fray </a>is now open. Although there is no show yet, you can get a
rough idea of what my plans are to get it completed.</font></p>
