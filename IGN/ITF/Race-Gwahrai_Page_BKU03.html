<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrai are a small, tree-dwelling race
found almost exclusively in one particular large forest somewhere near
Nnet Olotor's equator. They are named by the elves after their battle cry
/ distress call, which sounds like a high-pitched "gwaaahhhh!". They are
naturally equipped for the forest they call home. The avarage adult gwahrai
stands about 90 centimeters tall, and weighs around 20 pounds. They have
small and slender lemur-like bodies, small heads, long bushy tails, an
extra pair of hands in place of feet. They usually stand on all-fours,
but can stand on their hind legs for short periods of time. On the ground,
the gwahrai get around by bounding and crawling. Because of their lightweight
frame and powerful legs, they are able to leap great distances from a standing
start, and often use this ability to travel from tree to tree with great
ease. Each of the gwahrai's four hands have three very long fingers plus
an opposable thumb, so that their hands resemble an Earthen bird's claw,
minus the sharp points. The tip of each finger is a sticky circular pad,
much like those on the feet of Earthen frogs, allowing the gwahrai to hang
onto the sides of trees. They can also hang on branches using their tails.
The gwahrai are primarily herbavoires, living on the wide variety of vegitation
their forest provides. They also feast on insects when they get a chance.
They have an extremely high metabolism, and consume up to half their weight
of food daily. Most of the food the gwahrai eat is very high in nutrition,
contributing both to their highly energetic nature, and high level of intelligence.</font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PERSONALITY ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrai can be described as a spartan race
of people. They focus their lives around raising their young, contributing
to their community, and surviving the next predator attack. The driving
force of their society is maintaining the prosperity of the community,
rather than the acquisition of wealth. Most gwahrai don't understand the
concept of materialism, and look down on people who spend so much of their
hard earned resources to obtain expensive luxuries. The gwahrai tend to
persue only what they need to survive, although they have been known to
keep useless items of sentimental value, such as a first tooth, or an item
won from a defeated powerful enemy. They prefer practicality over glamour,
and would rather wear a comfortable but plain outfit, rather than a beautiful
outfit that restricts movement.</font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- LANGUAGE ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrais' evolutionary ancestors posessed
a very loud distress call which was similar to that of an Earthen sea gull.
The language they use today is based on that call, and is spoken through
the use of&nbsp; pitch and volume changes in the call, but also through
the limited use of sounds in human and elven lauages, as well as high and
low clicks. They are not physically capable of making all of the verbal
sounds of a human or elf, and are limited to the use of&nbsp; 'm', 'ow',
'g', 'oo', and 'ah'. To most outsiders, the gwahrai language may sound
like primitave howling, while in truth, it is just as intricate and articulate
as a language of any other race of people. The gwahrai have no written
language. Because of the nature of their language, it cannot be translated
into a written form in any known language, simply beacuse no letters exist
for some of the gwahrai language's sounds, although the same doesn't apply
to the actual meaning of the words.</font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- COMBAT ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> Because the gwahrai share their forest home
with predators that constantly hunt them, they have been forced to develop
certain defensive methods. They fight in small groups, and do not like
fighting out in the open. Since they are almost always significantly smaller
than their enemies, they obviously can't win by brute force. Instead, they
use their environment to their advantage, attacking the enemy with blowguns
and slings while remaining hidden.The gwahrai like to attack in this manner
until they have driven off or killed the enemy, or until discovered. If
the latter occurrs, the gwahrai then pounce on the enemy in relatively
large numbers, and attack with thornsticks and foriegn weapons they obtained
through trade. The prefered weapon of the gwahrai is the gwahrai thornstick.
The thornstick is a 40 centimeter long club made of the flexible, yet amazingly
durable, wood from their native trees. At the end of the thornstick is
a razor-sharp thorn, which adds an additional 15 to 25 centimeters to the
club. The gwahrai also use small weapons manufactured by members of other
races. These weapons are most commonly daggers, but also include short
swords (a long sword to a gwahrai), and spike-knuckles. A fighting gwahrai
depends on his/her quickness and agility to win a battle, and shuns anything
that compromises it, such as heavy armor, and heavy or any two-handed weapon.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> There are no specially trained or professional
soldiers. Rather than having a society that depends on an army or police
force to protect them, everyone, from the lowest to highest members of
society, and of both genders, is trained in the art of combat from an early
age. In the event of a predator attack or an invasion, the civilians can
postpone their daily duties and go into their "combat mode" at the drop
of a hat, in order to come to the defense of their villiage. When fighting
along side elves, the contrasting fighting techniques of the elves and
gwahrai complement each other well, making them a very formidable fighting
force. Fighting gwahrai rely on their great quickness and agility to bring
down enemies, and shuns anything that interferes with these qualities.
When forced to fight in close quarters, they try to always be ready to
dodge their enemies attacks, and immediately launch a counter-attack. Since
the gwahrai are used to moving so quickly and fluidly through the trees,
swinging on vines, bouncing off and climbing of the sides of trees, and
using both pairs of hands and their tails to grab and hang from branches
and vines, heavy armor and any two-handed objects would seriously hinder
their movements, thus making them far less formidable in battle.</font>
