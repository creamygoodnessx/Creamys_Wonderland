<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Genevieve Alexandria Stevens is
the daughter
of Earthen conqueror Emperor Stevens. She once had the potential of
being
a nice and sociable person, but an unkind childhood changed all that.
Genevieve
grew up in the Stevens Empire, a society dominated by idealism, in
which
its members are judged primarily by their social class, gender, and
physical
appearance. When Genevieve reached her adolescence, she did not fit the
empire's ideals as a good looking young lady, and was given a very hard
time for it from most of the people she knew, mainly her father and his
elitist peers. (The ideal look for a woman in the Steven's Empire is to
have a tall and slender body, and a youthful appearance, but Genevieve
was a very heavy set girl in her adolescence.)&nbsp; The empire is also
heavily male-oriented, in which men get to make all the important
decisions
and hold positions of power, while women are meant to be seen and not
heard,
and are given far fewer rights than male counterparts. Genevieve
refused
to accept herself an an inferior, and always questioned the empire's
gender
biased views. She repeatedly did things that were only acceptable for
men
to do, such as carrying a weapon, and wearing certain male attire,
which
earned her further resentment. Because the Stevens Empire looked down
on
the practice of magic as witchcraft, Genevieve's open fascination with
magic only made her even more of an outcast. Noone in Genevieve's
childhood
showed any compassion towards her, nor did they ever take anything she
said or did seriously. Whenever she tried to speak her mind in a
serious
manner, it was always passed off as a joke. Her father didn't even care
that she stood in the war room and listened in on his private military
meetings with his generals, top military advisors, and his Zodian
allies,
and he never thought that Genevieve might someday turn on him.
Genevieve
spent her early years toeing the line for her father and peers, and did
everything she could to please them, but all she ever got in return was
disdain and ungratefulness. Whenever Genevieve tried to resolve a
personal
dispute with her father in a diplomatic and peaceful way, her efforts
would
always be thrown back in her face with hostility, and her father would
remind her of how worthless she was. Every time such an incident
occurred,
it would stick into her memory for life, and permanently erode her ever
diminishing good nature.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Genevieve's only salvation came in
the
form of an elven slave who, like Genevieve, was an outcast to society,
simply because of his race and social status. This slave idea is still
relatively new, so I haven't yet come up with a name for him yet.
Because
the two were outcasts, it wasn't difficult for them to form a strong
emotional
bond. When Genevieve was twelve, she had once stood up for the slave,
and
protected him from a beating from his cruel owners. In return, the
slave
secretly spent his free time teaching her how to speak, read, and write
his language as a sign of gratitude. Although the slave could speak
English,
he had a strong accent from his native language, which was Nnet
Olotor's
most common elven language. As a result, the slave kept mispronouncing
Genevieve's name as "Johnny V". Genevieve took advantage of her new
language
abilities by reading elven literature and history. She also looked up
everything
she could about Nnet Olotor's various <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
orders</a>, and what she could do to someday become a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a>
herself. However, the Stevens Empire forbids the use of magic by law,
and
the penalty for violating this law is death. So, at the age of 16,
Genevieve
finally mustered up the courage to defect from the empire, to pursue
her
lifelong dream of becoming a mage. I'm not yet sure what happened to
the
slave. It's possible that Emperor Stevens brutally murdered him,
because
he discovered the truth and felt that the slave was corrupting his
daughter,
and that that was the final straw that pushed Genevieve to leave home.
Or perhaps Genevieve saw a once in a lifetime opportunity to help him
to
escape the empire, and decided it was a good idea for her to leave as
well.
This part is still very much up in the air.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; When Genevieve Stevens defected
from
the Stevens Empire, she officially adopted the name "Jonny-V", since it
was the name referred to her by the only person who ever appreciated
her.
Because she was no longer under the Stevens Empire's restrictive heel,
Jonny-V could pursue her lifelong dream to become a mage, and wasted no
time in doing so. Because of her hard work and fascination for the art
of magic, it wasn't long before she was granted a bit of <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a> of her own. (I'm not yet sure what magic order Jonny-V
joins,
but it will most likely be controlled by a neutral deity, and contains
an variety of very destructive spells.) Right after she became a mage,
Jonny-V began traveling throughout Nnet Olotor as a drifter, constantly
practicing her combat and magic skills, and looking for new ways to
test
her limits. She<font color="#ff8080"> is a decent fighter and a
relatively
powerful mage for someone who has been in the practice for less that
four
years. She knows a good number of spells in her magic order, as well as
a few magic techniques, some of which she developed herself. Jonny-V
takes
her combat and magic skills very seriously, because they are all she
ever
trusts. </font>She knows she will most likely confront her father or
his
empire at some point in time, and she's willing to do whatever it takes
to prepare herself for such a battle. I may even have her enter some
kind
of fighting tournament in order to test herself against some of the
world's
best fighters.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; After her defection, Jonny-V was
finally
starting to be respected as a person. The kindness showed to her by the
citizens of Nnet Olotor was a welcome change from the abuse from her
adolescence,
but the emotional damage of her past had already taken its toll on her
goodwill. As Jonny-V's past abuse by her father and his acquaintances
diminished
her innocence, she built an emotional wall around herself&nbsp; in
order
to cope with it. At the time, she was afraid to talk back to them,
because
she knew what they were capable of, so she was forced to keep her
emotions
bottled up. Jonny-V is constantly haunted by the fact she didn't
retaliate
against them when she had a chance, but does so vicariously through
other
people with her violent and explosive personality. Jonny-V is hostile
towards
everybody, and refuses to be nice to anyone in fear of someone taking
advantage
of her goodwill, like those during her adolescence did. Because her
trust
was repeatedly trampled on during her days in the Empire, she has vowed
to never trust anyone again. She secretly wants to return to her nice
and
trusting self, but doesn't know if she'll ever be able to work up the
courage
to do so. Besides, she figures that she's already made too bad of a
reputation
for herself for anyone to be friends with her anyway.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; At some point early on in the
story,
Jonny-V meets <font color="#ff8080"><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Oinkillune</a></font>.
Originally, I was going to have it so that Jonny-V had been watching
Oinkillune's
every move through a magic artifact she took from Zod's fortress before
she defected from the empire. The artifact would have allowed Jonny-V
to
see the world through Oinkillune's eyes. After her defection, she would
have visited Oinkillune and demand that he help her take down the
Stevens
Empire. However, after much thought, I've dropped this element from
Evil
Blood, and now I'm not really sure exactly how the two mee<font
 color="#ff8080">t.
The two will most likely have at least a few adventures together,
although
I only have a few sketchy ideas as to exactly what they may or may not
go through. Jonny-V envies Oinkillune for growing up in a loving
environment,
and wonders if the world would survive his potential wrath if he had
grown
up the way she had. It also upsets Jonny-V that she had to work hard to
build up every bit of her magic energy, while Oinkillune was simply
born
with his. As the story develops, certain events cause Jonny-V's
negative
traits to slowly recede, thanks in no small part to Oinkillune.</font></font>
