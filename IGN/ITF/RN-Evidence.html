<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 7) - Life
is constantly changing and evolving, and humans are just a small part of
it. Long ago, it was widely believed that life was static, and that all
living things were exactly the same as when they were first "created".
It was also believed that humans were a special lifeform, and not related
to the rest of the animal kingdom.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- Evil Blood will
be an evolution based story, in which after Nnet Olotor split from Earth,
it developed its own ecosystems, and life continued evolving on its own
until around 20,000 years before the first chapters of the story. The magic
energy field that mysteriously enters the world is influenced by the religious
beliefs of the Nnet Olotorian people, and allows new species of animals
to exist that wouldn't exist without the field.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">-&nbsp;&nbsp; -
Some existing creatures were magically modified by people in order to make
them more efficient as beasts of burden or for combat purposes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">-&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Some insect-like creatures could have been made more vicious or larger
in order to storm enemy strongholds.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">-&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Some large beasts could have been engineered as living battering rams
by increasing their threshold of pain, physical strength, and aggressiveness.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(Form page 8) - The
human skeleton is very similar to that of birds. Birds have longer necks,
and more joints than humans.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- If the gwahrai
race survives the continuous overhauling of Evil Blood, I may have the
hands and feet be similar in skeletal structure to that of birds. The gwahrai
may have long fingers, three joints in their hands instead of two, and
four or five fingers, including the thumb.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 8) - People
once thought that living matter could spontaneously arise from dead matter.
They misinterpreted what they saw when they observed maggots crawling out
of decaying meat, and frogs coming out of the ground after the spring floods
along the Nile. This theory, called "spontaneous generation", was later
proven false by scientific experimentation.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- Since Nnet Olotor's
magic energy field was influenced by the beliefs of the general population,
new creatures could have been created by the widespread but false belief
that living creatures could arise from dead matter. If people saw creatures
popping out of the ground in mass, their beliefs could create a similar
creature that actually was a result of spontaneous generation. This type
of enchanted creature could eventually become part of the magic order of
the deity of the people who witnessed the original creatures arising form
the ground, and the enchanted creatures could be created by casting a certain
spell. The spell would have to be cast on the same type of soil as what
the original creatures popped out of, and this soil could be considered
the spell's material component.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 9) - The
further down a fossil is found in the ground, the older it is.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 10) -
Swedish botanist Carollus Linnaeus was the first person to come up with
the official classification of the living world.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- Each organism
has two names, their genus, and their species. (canis lupus (grey wolf),
homo sapien (human), felis concolor (puma)).</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- After Linnaeus'
time, categories above genus were created</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- The taxonomists
groups of the animal and plant kingdoms are in the following order, from
most to least inclusive; Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.
This can be more easily remembered as "Please come over for gay sex." (TV
Funhouse)</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 10) -
The animal kingdom is categorized in a hierarchy of increasingly inclusive
groups, starting with the level of species.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 13) -
Individuals more suited to their environment have a better chance to survive
to reproductive age than their less favorably endowed counterparts. Creatures
that survive pass their favorable features genetically to future generations,
while those less suited die out. This is called Natural Selection.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 16) - "Fitness"
is determined by how well a species survives in its environment, and not
necessarily by the physical strength, speed, or ferocity of its individuals.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 16) - Survival
is not necessarily determined by competition. Group cooperation, and even
cooperation between species, can determine the species' fitness.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 18) -
Sometimes, genes go through a spontaneous change called a mutation. Most
mutations are so small, they can't normally be detected. Some rare genetic
mutations produce creatures that can't survive in their environment.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 18) - Genetic
mutations can be passed on to future generations. If certain mutations
are favorable for a species, individuals with those mutations will be more
likely to survive to reproduce than those without.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 18) - Each
favorable genetic mutation is usually too small to notice, but the results
become apparent as the number of mutations accumulate through several generations.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 19) -
Around 3 billion years ago, living matter did in fact arise from non-living
matter.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 19) - The
earliest fossils date back to 600 million years. This doesn't mean the
life began during that period , but rather when life forms first developed
hard parts capable of preservation.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 19) - Geochemical
dating suggests the Earth is about 5 billion years old.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 20) - Organic
materials of living matter are created when carbon dioxide, methane, and
ammonia are exposed to high amounts of electricity and ultra-violet radiation.
The first organic materials are the result of certain conditions during
the formation of the Earth. During this time, the Earth's crust was still
molten rock, and intense volcanic activity released carbon dioxide, methane,
and ammonia into the atmosphere.. The extreme heat of the atmosphere produced
electrical storms. Because there was no ozone layer, UV radiation from
the sun bombarded the planet.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 20) -
After the Earth's crust cooled, it rained continuously for millions of
years, creating the planet's oceans. These oceans had a high concentration
of of organic molecules, about 0.1% to 1% of the ocean's total molecules.
This concentration is sometimes called the "primeval soup" or "primordial
soup".</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 23) -
Evidence of evolution comes from two sources; the living world and the
fossil record.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 24) -
The taxonomic level at which two species is compared depends on the features
being considered.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 24) Domestic
dogs and wolves have the same basic skeletal structure, reproduce the same
way, have similar dental patterns, and are genetically compatible. Most
of the differences between the two species are superficial, so they belong
to the same genus(Canis).</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 24) - Because
the red fox is a dog-like creature just like the domestic dog or wolf,
all three belong to the dog family(Canidae). However, the red fox is in
a different genus(Vulpes) from the domestic dog and wolf, because of more
significant differences between them, such as in dental and skeletal structure.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 24) - Bears(the
family of Ursidae) and Canidae are all primarily carnivores, so they all
belong in a single order, Carnivora. However, bears are obviously different
from all dog-like forms.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 25) Species
are separated at the level of species if their differences are not adaptive
to their environment, but are only the result of chance mutations.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 25) - The
more strongly the adaptive features being considered when comparing two
species, the higher the taxonomic level from which they are split.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 28) -
If two groups of individuals of a species become geographically isolated,
they can no longer exchange genetic materials. This is called "reproductive
isolation". Since genetic mutations are random, it is unlikely the two
groups will have the same mutations, and differences will begin to appear
between them as a result. The randomness that causes these differences
is known as "genetic drift".</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 28) - If this
process happens for enough generations, the two groups may eventually become
separate species. Any differences in the environmental conditions of the
two groups will speed up the process, because of natural selection.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 33) - Should
the geographical barriers between the two groups disappear, and the two
groups begin exchanging genetic materials again, and any differences that
were the result of the genetic drift will be diffused.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- In a sentient species,
some religions forbid intermarriage between members of other religions.
This could be the case in Evil Blood, where in some of Nnet Olotor's religions,
the penalty for such intermarriage is death. If this policy were to be
successfully enforced for enough generations, those whose practiced it
would become increasingly different from those outside their religion,
because of genetic drift. After thousands of generations, members of the
religion would become noticeably different from the rest of the species,
and would become a separate species altogether.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 29) -
Since genetic change is random, several genetic variations often exist
within a species. If the species occupies a large geographical area, local
variants will have their own distinct characteristics. This is because
individuals in one area are far more likely to mate with members of surrounding
areas than with members of more distant areas. These local groups can be
considered to be sub-species of the species. When an individual mates with
a neighbor of a distant group, their offspring will have traits of both
local groups. Therefore, individuals with characteristics from multiple
groups exist, erasing any clear dividing lines between the sub-species.
The species is then considered to be polytypic.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 30) - If a
species is spread out over a large geographical area, its members may be
able to overcome geographical barriers and prevent genetic isolation if
they share three characteristics...</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The species must be able to travel long distances easily. Being large
helps.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The species must be able to survive in a variety of environments.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The members of the different areas must be tolerant of each other as
far as breeding goes.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 37) - If one
local group of a species stops breeding with outside groups, then intergrades
of the species will disappear. This usually happens as the result of geographic
isolation. At this point, a species is usually recognized as a separate
species from the original group.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From page 39) -
Polar bears began evolving from brown bears at the start of the last ice
age, over 10,000 years ago. The increasing cold and shrinking food supply
killed off most of the brown bears in the northern areas of the Old World.
In order to survive, the few surviving brown bears turned to the ocean
for food. Here they became geographically isolated from the rest of the
brown bear population. Only the bears who were best able to cope with the
arctic environment survived to pass on their genes to further generations.
As conditions grew worse, natural selection forced these generations to
adapt features that helped the bears survive in the arctic sea. Eventually,
the polar bears became dependent on their new environment for survival.
When the glaciers began to retreat, and the brown bears returned, the polar
bears could no longer compete, and were forced to travel north.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- There could be
a point in the story of Evil Blood where a large group of people was forced
out of their homeland, and had to live in a far less hospitable environment.
This could be the result of persecution on a large scale, or a natural
disaster. Most of the people died as a result of the harshness of the environment,
but those who survived were able to pass their more favorable genetic traits
down to their descendants. This could have caused the people to evolve
into a new species from their original one.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 63) -
Life on Earth began in the ocean. Most terrestrial life made their way
into fresh water through rivers, and then traveled onto land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 66) - Some
ocean life-forms came to land by way of the tidal zone (through beaches).</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 66) -
Since all life depends on green plants as the ultimate food source, in
order for animals live in a particular area, green plants must first thrive
there. After plant-eaters settle in the area to eat the plants, the meat-eaters
soon follow and prey on the plant-eaters.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 66) - The
tiny plant life that lived in the ocean was picked up by violent storms
and water spouts, and many were deposited in fresh water environments (lakes,
rivers, etc.).</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 67) - Once
the tiny plant life had established itself in fresh water, it attracted
the plant-eaters. But in order for the plant-eaters to reach the fresh
water, they had to travel up the rivers. Some of the creatures that could
do this were the ones that walked on the ocean floor, because they could
fight the rivers' current.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 67) - Once
in the creatures settled in fresh water, they evolved features that helped
them to better survive in that environment, such as tolerance of lower
salinity.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 69) - Because
the first fresh water creatures had no competition, they easily thrived
in their new environment.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 73) -
Cephalopods (octopus, squid, etc.) were so successful at life in the ocean
that they did not have the incentive to travel into fresh water, even though
they were preadapted for life in that environment.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 75) -
Jaws evolved from the breathing mechanism of early jawless fish, the agnaths.
The jaws of all living vertebrates are operated by the same nerves as the
front pairs of respiratory gill bars of the agnaths. As the agnaths grew
larger, they needed a way to draw in more oxygen to accommodate for their
size. This led to the mobility of the creatures' gill bars, which soon
had the capability of clamping onto prey. The gill bars then were converted
into grasping jaws, and grew tiny teeth, making catching prey even easier.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

The adaptations that allowed marine lifeforms to move to fresh water eventually
allowed their fresh water evolutionary descendants to move to land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 79) - The
skeleton that allowed marine vertebrates to swim against the river currents
gave fresh water vertebrates structural support on land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 79) - The
legs that enabled some marine creatures to walk against the current of
rivers also enabled their evolutionary descendants to walk on land.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 80) -
The first aquatic creatures to invade land were small creatures. Their
small size helped them because they needed less structural support than
larger creatures.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 80) - Land
creatures must have a stronger skeletal structure than aquatic creatures,
because on land, there's no water to reduce the effects of gravity.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 80) - Small
size could be considered to be a preadaptive feature to life on land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 80) - As land
creatures grew larger, their skeleton became stronger and more rigid. Their
larger size allowed them to travel greater distances on land.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 80) -
There are more species in any one class of land vertebrates than in all
of the aquatic species in the world.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 80) -
Some land creatures have evolved characteristics for a return of life in
the sea. These creatures include water beetles and whales.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 80) -
In order to prevent dehydration, the arthropods have an exoskeleton, while
the vertebrates developed thicker skin.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 81) -
Plants were the first lifeforms from water to populate land. They began
as algae, but eventually became better suited to life on land, and became
known as higher green plants.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 81) - Higher
green plants have better outer coverings than algae, and have surface opening
to exchange gasses with the atmosphere.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 81) - Psilopsids
are the earliest known higher green plants. They have water conductive
tissues, but don't have roots or leaves.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- Does chlorophyl
necessarily have to be green? If not, and chlorophyl color was random when
it was created, plant life on Net Olotor can be primarily any color, for
instance purple or pink. Of course, this means that many creatures on Net
Olotor will also be purple or pink in order to take advantage of their
environment, primarily through the use of camouflage.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 84) -
The single most important preadaptive feature a sea creature needs to adapt
to life on land is a form of lung.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 84) - Ancient
fossils of placoderms, an extinct form of early fish, had a "blind pouch".
This pouch branches off from the throat, and is where the lungs would be
if it were a land creature.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 84) - Many
of today's fish have a "swim bladder", a gas filled bag that helps the
fish control buoyancy, and in some species of fish, aids in respiration.
In fish embryos, the swim bladder is in the same position as the lungs
in the embryos of land vertebrates. These swim bladders evolved into lungs
after the fish began spending time on land.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 85) -
The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the first tetrapods, which are any creatures
that travel on four legs.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 88) - The
lobe-fins were pre-adapted for life on land, because they already had a
certain organ that was capable of breathing air.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 88) - The
lobe-fins first used their fins on land to crawl from pool to pool as the
pools evaporated. Any characteristics that made this land trip easier were
strongly selected for, and thus the lobe-fins developed features for traveling
on land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Small size was initially favored, because this allows the fish to require
less skeletal support. However, larger size eventually became favored,
because it allowed the fish to travel longer distances on land.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The lobe-fins evolved greater flexibility, because walking on land requires
greater flexibility than swimming does.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The lobe-fins' fins became longer and stronger in order to make walking
easier.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- The lobe-fins fed on arthropods while traveling between pools. This was
their motivation for remaining on land, and allowed them to give rise to
land vertebrates.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 88) -
For nearly 35 million years, there was only one type of tetrapod in the
world, the ichthyostega. When new varieties began to appear, most of them
looked like lizards and salamanders, with proportionately small legs. At
this point, they could be classified as reptiles and amphibians, based
on how they reproduced.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

Flight in insects probably began with individuals with rigid projections
that allowed them to glide. Eventually, these projections would become
mobile, allowing for a more controlled flight.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 93) - Once
insects had developed flight, they were able to travel long distances.

<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 96) Pelycosauria,
an order under the reptile class, had a sail-shaped body. When they needed
to warm up, they stood so that the sun would hit them broadside. When they
needed to cool down, they turned toward the sun, which minimized the amount
of sunlight hitting their bodies.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 97) -
In order to conserve water, modern lizards and birds excrete their waste
as nearly dry pellets or as slurry. The diapsids, the creatures that eventually
evolved into lizards and birds, also had this water conserving feature,
which allowed them to follow their insect prey into drier areas. The diapsids
no longer had to look for water, because they got all the moisture they
needed from their food.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

The more body mass (volume) a creature has, the faster it will gain heat.
The more surface area a creature has, the faster it will lose heat.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 98) The larger
dinosaurs cooled off very slowly. Because their muscles were so big, they
also generated a lot of body heat. This put them at risk of overheating.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp;
- One method animals can use to avoid overheating is panting. However,
large dinosaurs were too large for panting to be efficient. Instead, they
seeked the shelter of large bodies of water to cool themselves off.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 104) -
Insectivores are the earliest of the advanced mammals.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 104) - Although
insectivores feed primarily on insects, they also include vegetation in
their diet.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 104) - Because
insectivores are small creatures, they can easily hide from predators,
and don't have elude them by running fast over long distances.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 104) - Insectivores
have flat, five-toed feet that have some grasping ability.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 105) - Insectivores
have a five-fingered hand with an opposable thumb. When some of the insectivores
found their way into the trees, they developed these grasping hands and
eventually gave rise to primates.</font></font>
<br><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 105) - One
disadvantage insectivores suffer because of their small size, is that they
lose heat very rapidly. In order to stay warm, they must eat constantly,
and consume several times their weight in food. The insectivores' descendants
that became larger, including rodents and primates, no longer had this
problem.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#33FF33">- The gwahrai race
is heavily influenced by insectivores and early primates, and has many
of their physical features. The gwahrai are adapted for a life of climbing
trees, gathering fruits, and eluding predators. They have three long fingers
and an opposable thumb on both their hands and their feet. This was originally
developed to make it easier for them to grab branches and pick up food,
but it also came in handy for using weapons. The gwahrai once eluded predators
by hiding high in the trees, and could easily outrun most of them as long
as they stayed in the trees. But eventually, they began to actively defend
themselves against such predators, fighting back with whatever they could
use as a weapon. The gwahrai's diet consists mainly of vegetation, although
they also feed on insects when they get the chance.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
