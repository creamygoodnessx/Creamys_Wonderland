DESCRIPTION

</center>
<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The gwahrai
are
a small, tree-dwelling race found almost exclusively in one particular
large tropical forest somewhere near Nnet Olotor's equator. They are
named
by the elves after their battle cry / distress call, which sounds like
a high-pitched "gwaaahhhh!". They are naturally equipped for the forest
they call home. The average adult gwahrai stands about 90 centimeters
tall,
and weighs around 20 pounds. They have small and slender lemur-like
bodies,
small heads, long bushy tails, an extra pair of hands in place of feet.
They usually stand on all fours, but can stand on their hind legs for
short
periods of time. On the ground, the gwahrai get around by bounding and
crawling. Because of their lightweight frame and powerful legs, they
are
able to leap great distances from a standing start, and often use this
ability to travel from tree to tree with great ease. Each of the
gwahrai's
four hands have three very long fingers plus an opposable thumb, so
that
their hands resemble an Earthen bird's claw, minus the sharp points.
The
tip of each finger is a sticky circular pad, much like those on the
feet
of Earthen frogs, allowing the gwahrai to hang onto the sides of trees.
They can also hang on branches using their tails. The gwahrai are
primarily
herbivores, living on the wide variety of vegetation their forest
provides.
They also feast on insects when they get a chance. They have an
extremely
high metabolism, and consume up to half their weight of food daily.
Most
of the food the gwahrai eat is very high in nutrition, contributing
both
to their highly energetic nature, and high level of intelligence.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Out of all
the
sentient beings on Nnet Olotor, the gwahrai are by far the most
dependent
on their natural environment for survival. While they benefit greatly
from
being so well adapted for the forest they call home, they don't adapt
well
to any other environment. The gwahrai are strictly tropical creatures,
and would not survive long under any cold conditions. The trees provide
shelter from the predators that constantly hunt them. But the one thing
that ties the gwahrai to the forest more than anything else is their
limited
diet. The gwahrai's forest home has an array of vegetation that
provides
the gwahrai with the optimal balance of nutrients they need to stay
healthy
and active. While other places on Nnet Olotor have vegetation that is
tolerable
for gwahrai consumption, such vegetation may not fully fulfill their
strict
diet requirements. As a result, gwahrai who travel to foreign towns and
cities are usually not as energetic as they would be in their native
habitat.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

</center>
<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The gwahrai
can
be described as a spartan race of people. They focus their lives around
raising their young, contributing to their community, and surviving the
next predator attack. The driving force of their society is maintaining
the prosperity of the community, rather than the acquisition of wealth.
Most gwahrai don't understand the concept of materialism, and look down
on people who spend so much of their hard earned resources to obtain
expensive
luxuries. The gwahrai tend to pursue only what they need to survive,
although
they have been known to keep useless items of sentimental value, such
as
a first tooth, or an item won from a defeated powerful enemy. They
prefer
practicality over glamour, and would rather wear a comfortable but
plain
outfit, rather than a beautiful outfit that restricts movement.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; The gwahrai are <font
 color="#ff8080">exceptionally
curious about the world around them, and are often seen exploring the
forest
well outside of their villages. Sometimes, they're even seen traveling
outside the forest, usually in the company of members of other races.
Unlike
many other races who naturally fear the unknown until it proves itself
safe, the gwahrai don't fear anything until they have a reason to fear
it.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

---</font></font></p>
</center>
<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Because the
gwahrai
are so well physically adapted to their forest home, they don't need to
change their environment to suit themselves, like members of most other
races do. Not surprisingly, the gwahrai have an extraordinary knowledge
of the forest, and know how to use it to suit their needs. They know
what
berries are good to eat, how to make crude weapons and tools, etc.
Since
more than enough food grows wild in the forest to support the gwahrai
population,
they never needed to develop agriculture. The gwahrai don't have to
worry
about overpopulation, since they can only mate at certain times each
year,
and because they are regularly the victims of predator attacks. Because
the forest provides the gwahrai everything they need for survival, and
because it's in a tropical zone, the gwahrai are able to establish
permanent
villages, and don't have to migrate in response to any climate changes.
Although a rare occurrence, some gwahrai families have been known to
live
in the civilizations of elves and humans. However, due mainly to the
gwahrai's
physical dependence to the forest, most of them do not expand and
settle into new
territories, but stick to the forest generation after generation.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Some gwahrai
villages
are shared peacefully with woodland elves in what can be called a
"bunk-bed"
coexistence; the elves living on the forest floor while the gwahrai
reside
high in the trees. The two races intermingle in certain events, such as
out-of-forest adventures, hunting trips, survival training, and
festivals.
The gwahrai were the primary influence of the culture of the first
generations
of wood elves, and shaped how the elves felt about things like gender
equality,
law, and warfare.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">--- LANGUAGE ---</font></font></p>
</center>
<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The
gwahrais' evolutionary
ancestors possessed a very loud distress call which was similar to that
of an Earthen sea gull. The language they use today is based on that
call,
and is spoken through the use of&nbsp; pitch and volume changes in the
call, but also through the limited use of sounds in human and elven
languages,
as well as high and low clicks. They are not physically capable of
making
all of the verbal sounds of a human or elf, and are limited to the use
of&nbsp; 'm', 'ow', 'g', 'oo', and 'ah'. To most outsiders, the gwahrai
language may sound like primitive howling, while in truth, it is just
as
intricate and articulate as a language of any other race of people. The
gwahrai have no written language. Because of the nature of their
language,
it cannot be translated into a written form in any known language,
simply
because no letters exist for some of the gwahrai language's sounds,
although
the same doesn't apply to the actual meaning of the words.</font></font><font

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">--- COMBAT ---</font></font></p>
</center>
<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Because the
gwahrai
share their forest home with predators that constantly hunt them, they
have been forced to develop certain defensive methods. They fight in
small
groups, and do not like fighting out in the open. Since they are almost
always significantly smaller than their enemies, they obviously can't
win
by brute force. Instead, they use their environment to their advantage,
attacking the enemy with blowguns and slings while remaining hidden.
The
gwahrai like to attack in this manner until they have driven off or
killed
the enemy, or until discovered. If the latter occurs, the gwahrai then
pounce on the enemy in relatively large numbers, and attack with
thornsticks
and foreign weapons they obtained through trade. The preferred weapon
of
the gwahrai is the gwahrai thornsticks. The thornsticks is a 40
centimeters
long club made of the flexible, yet amazingly durable, wood from their
native trees. At the end of the thornsticks is a razor-sharp thorn,
which
adds an additional 15 to 25 centimeters to the club. The gwahrai also
use
small weapons manufactured by members of other races. These weapons are
most commonly daggers, but also include short swords (a long sword to a
gwahrai), and spike-knuckles. A fighting gwahrai depends on his/her
quickness
and agility to win a battle, and shuns anything that compromises it,
such
as heavy armor, and heavy or any two-handed weapon. </font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; There are no
specially
trained or professional soldiers. Rather than having a society that
depends
on an army or police force to protect them, everyone, from the lowest
to
highest members of society, and of both genders, is trained in the art
of combat from an early age. In the event of a predator attack or an
invasion,
the civilians can postpone their daily duties and go into their "combat
mode" at the drop of a hat, in order to come to the defense of their
village.
When fighting along side elves, the contrasting fighting techniques of
the elves and gwahrai complement each other well, making them a very
formidable
fighting force. Fighting gwahrai rely on their great quickness and
agility
to bring down enemies, and shun anything that interferes with these
qualities.
When forced to fight in close quarters, they try to always be ready to
dodge their enemies attacks, and immediately launch a counter-attack.
Since
the gwahrai are used to moving so quickly and fluidly through the
trees,
swinging on vines, bouncing off and climbing of the sides of trees, and
using both pairs of hands and their tails to grab and hang from
branches
and vines, heavy armor and any two-handed objects would seriously
hinder
their movements, thus making them far less formidable in battle.</font></font><font
