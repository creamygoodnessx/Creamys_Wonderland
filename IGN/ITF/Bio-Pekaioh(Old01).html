<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The first
Zodian
War ended several thousand years ago when a super-powerful hero
defeated
the evil deity Zod in single combat. I haven't yet worked out any of
the
details of this war, nor any details about the hero, but hopefully that
will be taken care of as I continue to develop Evil Blood's background
story. Because of the hero's tremendous power and bravery, his spirit
was
preserved after he died. From that point on, whenever Nnet Olotor was
in
peril, the spirit of the hero would be reborn within one of his male
decendants.
There would always be some way for the right people to identify the
reborn
hero, be it a birthmark, an instictual action, or something else that
was
unique to the hero. After the new hero was discovered, he would be
required
to begin training to face the peril immediately, often abandoning his
familiar
life in the process. The hero would always have access to a particular
magic order from birth, and the potential to become an exceptionally
powerful
mage, much like an angel. But unlike most angels, the hero would be
able
to access other magic orders as well. The hero's inborn magic order
will
most likely be the same one as the original hero.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; At an early
age,
a young elven boy named Roonaii Pekaioh was told that he was the
reincarnated
spirit of the hero that defeated Zod. After his identity was
discovered,
he was immediately dragged away from his familiar surroundings, and
trained
by some of the best clerics and champion fighters to face not only the
threat of Zod should he be resurrected, but also growing threat of the
Stevens Empire. After a few years of rigorous combat training, Pekaioh
became a very powerful fighting mage for someone in his mere
adolescence.
However, as his magic energy and fighting skills increased, so did his
vanity. He began to become more concerned with his public image than
his
actual level of skill, and wasted a lot of his money on fancy clothes
and
jewelry, flaunting his image as a legendary hero at every opportunity.
He looks down upon less gifted fighters as inferiors, and is very open
about his disrespect towards them. Pekaioh thinks of himself as a
defender
of justice to be worshipped by the masses, and a symbol of extreme
fighting
prowess to be feared by the forces of evil.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; I'm not yet
entirely
certain how Pekiaoh will enter the story, but I will most likely have
him
be an on-and-off member of Jonny-V's party at some point. He may first
appear in the story while answering one of Jonny-V's violent public
combat
challenges. If such a battle were to take place, it would be a very
close
contest, but Jonny-V would come out on top and spare Pekaioh's life for
putting up a sufficiently good fight. Much later on in the series, the
two would meet again, but this time Pekaioh would assist Jonny-V and
Oinkillune
in overcoming the Stevens Empire.</font></font>
