<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The gwahrai are a small, tree-dwelling race
found almost exclusively in one particular large forest on Nnet Olotor.
They are named by the elves after their battle cry / distress call, which
sounds like a high-pitched "gwaaahhhh!". The gwahrai are naturally equipped
for the forest they call home. They have small and slender lemur-like bodies,
small heads, long bushy tails, an extra pair of hands in place of feet,
and usually stand on all-fours.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* the average adult gwahrai stands 90 centimeters
tall, and weighs around 20 pounds.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* hair</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* lifespan</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* colors (fur, eyes, etc.)</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* decended from...</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Since the forest is warm all year round, it's
most likely to be in a tropical environment, which would put it close to
Nnet Olotor's equator.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* very high motabolism; eat constantly</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* strictly herbivores</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PERSONALITY ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* prefer comfort over glamour.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* exceptionally curious about the world around
them.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* very chaotic in nature, and generally don't
take orders very well, and don't like to be told what to do.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* very energetic</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* generally don't fear something until there's
a reason to fear it.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* evil gwahrai are few and far between.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* the driving force of a gwahrai is maintaining
the prosperity of the community, rather than the acquisition of wealth.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* do-it-yourselfers.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrai can best be described as a spartan
race of people. They focus their lives around raising their young, ...
and surviving the next predator attack. The driving force of their society
is maintaining the prosperity of the community, rather than the acquisition
of wealth. </font><font color="#FF0000">They have little use on things
they deem unnecessary, such as fancy jewelry</font><font color="#FF8080">
Most gwahrai don't understand why the humans and elves spend so much of
their hard earned resouces to obtain</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">--- CIVILIZATION ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* because members of both genders are physically
very similiar, females are seen as social equals to their male counterparts.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* because the forest provides the gwahrai everything
they need for survival, and it's warm all year long, the gwahrai are able
to establish permanent villiages, and don't have to migrate.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* frequently seen in small groups venturing outside
the forest, often with the company of woodland elves.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Although a rare occurence, some gwahrai families
have been known to live in the civiliations of elves and humans. However,
the gwahrai civilization does not expand and settle into new territories,
but stick to the forest generation after generation.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The benefits and hazards to a gwahrai's lifespan
have helped the gwahrai to establish a population equilibrium with their
environment, so that they neither have to worry about overpopulation nor
endangerment of extinction.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* overwhelmingly peaceful, but will not hesitate
to defend themselves when need be.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Some gwahrai villiages are shared peacefully
with woodland elves in what can be called a "bunk-bed" coexsistance; the
elves living on the forest floor while the gwahrai reside high in the trees.
The two races intermingle in certain events, such as out-of-forest adventures,
hunting trips, survival training, and festivals.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The gwahrai were the primary influence of the
culture of the first generations of wood elves, and shaped how the elves
felt about things like gender equality, law, and warfare.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Can't understand why the other races are so
materialistic, and see materialism in general as a weakness.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Greatly value individual freedom</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Have an extraordinary knowledge of the forest.
(What berries are good to eat, how to make crude weapons and tools, etc.)</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Since enough food grows wild in the forest
to support the gwarai population, they never needed to develop agriculture.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">--- LANGUAGE ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* the gwahrai's evolutionary ancestors posessed
a very loud mating call which was simalair to that of an Earthen sea gull.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* no written language.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* because of the nature of the gwarai language,
it cannot be translated into a written form in any known language, simply
beacuse no letters exist for the gwahrai language's sounds, although the
same doesn't apply to the actual meaning of the words.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* the language is spoken through the limited
use of sounds in human and elven lauages, high and low clicks, and pitch
and volume changes in the gwahrai call.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* not capable of making all of the verbal sounds
of a human or elf.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* To most outsiders, the Gwahrai language may
sound like primitave howling, while in truth, it is just as intricate and
... as a language of any other race of people.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">--- COMBAT ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Because the gwahrai share their forest home
with predators that constantly hunt them, the gwahrai have been forced
to develop certain defensive methods.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* fight in small groups</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The gwahrai do not like fighting out in the
open, and since they are almost always significantly smaller than their
enemies, they obviously can't win by brute force. Instead, they use their
environment to their advantage, attacking the enemy with blowguns and slings
while remaining hidden. They like to attack in this manner until they have
driven off or killed the enemy, or until discovered. If the latter occurrs,
the gwahrai then pounce on the enemy in relatively large numbers, and attack
with thornsticks and foriegn weapons they obtained through trade.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The prefered weapon of the gwahrai is the gwahrai
thornstick. The thornstick is a 50 centimeter long club made of the flexible,
yet amazingly durable, wood from their native trees. At the end of the
thornstick is a razor-sharp thorn, which adds an additional 15 to 25 centimeters
to the club.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* The gwahrai also use small weapons manufactured
by other races. These weapons are most commonly daggers, but also include
short swords (a long sword to a gwahrai), spike-knuckles, and ... A fighting
gwahrai depends on his/her quickness and agility to win a battle, and shuns
anything that compromises it, such as heavy armor, and heavy or any two-handed
weapon.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* There are no specially trained or professional
soldiers. Rather than having a society that depends on an army or police
force to protect them, everyone, from (the lowest to highest members of
society), and of both genders, is trained in the art of combat from an
early age. In the event of a predator attack or an invasion, the civilians
can postpone their daily duties and go into their "combat mode" at the
drop of a hat, in order to come to the defense of their villiage.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* When fighting along side elves, the contrasting
fighting techniques of the elves and gwahrai complement each other well,
making them a very formidable fighting force.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Fighting gwahrai rely on their great quickness
and agility to bring down enemies, and shuns anything that interferes with
these qualities. When forced to fight in close quarters, they try to always
be ready to dodge their enemies attacks, and immediately launch a counter-attack.
Since the gwahrai are used to moving so quickly and fluidly through the
trees, swinging on vines, bouncing off and climbing of the sides of trees,
and using both pairs of hands and their tails to grab and hang from branches
and vines, heavy armor and any two-handed objects would seriously hinder
their movements, thus making them far less formidable in battle.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">--- CLOTHES ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* the tropical environment allows only for light
clothing</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* comfort of primary importance over beauty</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* gwahrai usually sleep nude</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* materials of clothing</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* some gwahrai like to wear light jewelry</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* unisex attire</font>
