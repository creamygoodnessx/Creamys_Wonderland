<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Stardancer
is a
young human teenage girl, approximately 13 years of age. She is the
classic
peaches and cream type; shy and reserved, passive and soft spoken. She
is good natured, polite and 'lady-like', but is extremely pessimistic,
and often lacks the confidence to express her thoughts. When Stardancer
enters the story, she is found naked and unconscious on a beach by our
heroes. Since there is no wreckage found near Stardancer, the heroes
conclude
that she fell overboard from a passing vessel and then washed ashore.
She
has no memory of her past, and can't remember her family, where she
lives,
or even her name. As an improvisation, one of our heroes gives her a
temporary
name, which will be 'Stardancer' until I can come up with something
more
relevant. (Whoever gives the girl her name will most likely choose a
name
that's dear to him/her.) Since the party is headed for the city which
bears
the Orb of Knowledge, <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Jonny-V%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Jonny-V</a> suggests that Stardancer pay a visit to the
Orb in the hopes that doing so will help Stardancer regain her memory,
and reunite her with her loved ones.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Our heroes
had
no trouble gaining Stardancer's trust, and they quickly formed a strong
emotional bond with her, especially </font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Oinkillune</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080">, who began seeing her as
an ideal sister. Stardancer has a strong dislike against weapons and
other
things that kill. She is uncomfortable being near weapons of any kind,
even those in the hands of her new found friends. When her life is
threatened,
Stardancer's reaction is to beg for mercy or hide behind her friends,
rather
than to defend herself. However, as the story progresses, she slowly
adjusts
to her temporary but dangerous lifestyle, and begins to understand
the party's need to defend itself. Later on in the story, she may
perform
and unexpected feat of courage when backed into a corner, or when the
life
of one of her friends is in danger. Stardancer's meek and trusting
nature
disturbs Jonny-V, because she herself was very much like that growing
up
in the Stevens Empire. She sees such a nature as a weakness that others
can exploit, and feels that if Stardancer doesn't change, someone will
take advantage of her and destroy her emotionally. Jonny-V gives
Stardancer
a sample of the abuse she suffered as a child in an effort to get
Stardancer
to toughen up, and to get her to stand up for herself. But helping
Stardancer
change makes Jonny-V realise that she still has the capability to
genuinely
care for people other than herself, and helps her to become less evil.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Since
Stardancer's
earliest memory at the beach where Jonny-V and Oinkillune found her,
she's
had the ability to read other people's emotions. Jonny-V didn't find
this
ability to be all too unusual, since a small percentage of sentient
beings
on Nnet Olotor, including humans, have this ability. Even Earth, where
no magic energy field is known to exsist, has its share of telepathic
individuals.
On the party's way to the Orb of Knowledge, they may run into
situations
where Stardancer's emotion reading ability comes in handy.</font></font>
