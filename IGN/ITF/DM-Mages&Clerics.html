being who learns and uses magic spells.
Before someone can learn any spells, he/she must believe in and worship
a given deity, just like any other follower of that deity. Since </font></font><font

 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"> is the fuel of all spellcasting, a mage's body must
become receptive
to this energy in order to cast any spells. No naturally created person
is born with this ability. Magic energy is a divine force, produced and
governed by the deities, and only they have the ability to bestow their
magical energy upon their worshippers. But they don't just give out
their
power freely to anyone who asks for it. Any aspiring mage must go
through
a series of rigorous tests in order to prove himself/herself worthy of
the right to use the deity's magic. These tests vary from religion to
religion,
sometimes from deity to deity. In some orders of magic, the series of
tests
is extremely dangerous, and failure could result in death. In other
orders,
the tests are not dangerous, but anyone who fails will never be allowed
to retake them, or will be required to wait a number of months or years
before trying again. Some religions call for tests that may be in the
form
of state-run annual tournaments, in which during the ceremony at the
end
of the tournament, the very deities of the religion appear in physical
form and grant their magic energy to the winners. I haven't yet thought
of what any of these tests actually are, but they will always be
designed
to test the subjects to see if they have what it takes to support the
interests
of their religion and/or specific deity. When a mage is granted magical
energy, his/her body gains the ability to absorb the magic energy of
his/her
deity from Nnet Olotor's energy field, and to store a certain amount of
this energy within his/her body. The mage is also given access to all
of
the spells in the deity's </font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font

 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080">, except for the ones reserved for
clerics and the deity himself/herself. After receiving these magical
abilities,
the mage must continue to remain loyal to his/her deity, and fulfill
the
deity's religious requirements, such as daily prayer, sabbath, dietary
restrictions, alignment restrictions, or even animal sacrifices,
depending
on the religion and deity. A mage who fails to meet these requirements
may have his/her magical abilities revoked, but can usually regain them
through sufficient atonement.</font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><font
 size="+1">Learning
and casting spells</font></font></font></u></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; After
earning a
deity's magic energy, a mage will have access to most of the spells in
the deity's magic order, but must learn each one on his/her own. Many
spells
require the mage to perform spoken words and body motions to activate
it,
but these alone are never enough to cast the spells. The heart of all
spells
is their individual thought patterns that must be performed along with
the words and body motions. Since the thought pattern of a spell is
difficult
to interpret accurately from the explanations of written text or a
teacher,
the mage must often figure out the pattern by practicing the spell
through
trial and error. The first few successful castings are often weak, but
the results improve as the mage continues to fine tune the casting of
the
spell by making better educated guesses at the precise words, body
motions
and thought patterns through repeated castings. Perfecting a spell can
take a few days to several years depending on the spell, because every
successful or partially successful casting will drain a mage of a
certain
amount of his/her magic energy, and once it's gone, the mage will have
to wait until he/she has enough power to try the spell again. A
spellcaster's
body is constantly drawing in his/her deity's magic energy from Nnet
Olotor's
energy field, and once he/she has used up all of his/her magic energy,
it will usually take about twelve hours to fully recharge, but this
process
goes faster if the mage is asleep, taking only about eight hours.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; When a mage
first
receives his/her magical abilities, he/she is given as much energy as
his/her
body can comfortably hold, and the maximum amount of energy he/she can
hold at once depends on his/her physical condition. As the mage's body
gets used to the energy through repeated spellcasting over the years,
this
maximum will slowly increase. Powerful spells can cost a mage more
magic
energy than his/her initial maximum, but once the maximum exceeds the
cost
of a spell, it will become open to the mage once he/she learns it. If a
mage tries to cast a spell he/she does not have enough magic energy to
cast, the spell will die out before it is completed (assuming the mage
is able to perform it correctly), wasting the mage's energy. A higher
maximum
magic energy capacity also allows a mage to cast simple spells more
often
before having to recharge. A mage will always take roughly the same
amount
of time to recharge his/her magic energy from empty to full regardless
of his/her maximum capacity, because the increase of power is
proportionate
to the mage's maximum. This means that the higher a mage's maximum
magic
energy capacity is, the faster his/her body will regenerate the energy.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The more
powerful
a spell is, the more difficult it is to cast, the longer it takes to
learn,
and more magic energy it drains from the caster. The simplest spells of
any magic order often require a simple body motion, one or two words if
any, the thought of a single image, usually take about a second to
cast,
and cost only a small amount of magic power. These spells are handy
when
the mage has only seconds to react to an emergency, and can include
spells
that levitate the caster or another object for a few seconds. The most
powerful spells in a magic order eat up so much magic energy, that it
takes
several mages to pool their magic energy together and cast it in
unison,
and they all must perform it to perfection. Such spells may exceed two
minutes in casting time. These ultra powerful spells range from city
leveling
earthquakes to a mass resurrections.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Some spells
even
require material components to cast. These components can be anything
from
a dash of salt, to a live insect, to a bit of sulfur, and must be used
in accordance to the spell being cast. For example, a spell that
protects
an area from fire would require the mage to draw a big circle of ash on
ground around the intended parameter. A spell that allows someone to
climb
walls and ceilings like a spider (or a Nnet Olotorian equivalent) would
require the recipient of the spell to eat a live spider as the spell is
being cast.</font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><font
 size="+1">Multiple
magic orders</font></font></font></u></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; It's
possible for
a mage on Nnet Olotor to obtain the powers of more than one deity. As I
mentioned earlier, a mage must remain loyal to his/her deity in order
to
keep the magic energy received from that deity. There is a wide variety
of deities on Nnet Olotor, many of them with conflicting ideals, moral
standards, and religious laws. Therefore, worshipping certain
combinations
of deities is not possible for a mage, since a certain means of homage
to one deity (required for a mage to keep the magic energy of that
deity)
may be a forbidden act to another (punishable by the loss of the mage's
magic energy of that deity). The great majority of mages who cast
spells
from multiple magic orders only follow deities within the same
religion,
since the chances of a conflict are minimal this way.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; If a mage
wishes
to become a member of more than one magic order, he/she will need to
earn
the magical energy from all magic orders he/she wishes to cast spells
from.
In such a case, the magic energy from each of his/her magic orders will
be divided evenly within his/her body. Thus, if when the mage gets
blessed
with magic energy from his/her second magic order, he/she will lose
half
of his/her magic power from the first order in order to accommodate
his/her
second order. Likewise, if the mage obtains a third magic order, the
amount
of magic energy from the mage's first two orders will be reduced, so
that
the energy of each of his/her three orders will be an even third of
his/her
total magic energy.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Some spells
are
shared by a number of magic orders which they are applicable to. For
example,
a volcano god would grant fire and earth-based spells to his believers,
while a sun god would grant fire and life-based spells. Since both
deities
have fire-based spells in their magic orders, both of their magic
orders
could offer similar spells, such as those that allow spellcasters to
throw
fireballs, or those that grant the caster fire resistance. If an
experienced
mage wishes to cast fire-based spells, but his/her magic order doesn't
support any, he/she can begin worshipping a second deity who runs a
magic
order that does. The obvious choice who be a deity whose magic order
specializes
in fire-based magic, but if that deity's religious requirements
conflict
with the first deity's restrictions, the two magic orders are
incompatible,
and therefore obtaining the magic energy of the second order will cost
the mage the ability to cast spells from the first. Since a mage who's
broken his/her back to gain access to his/her first magic order, then
invested
months, perhaps years, learning and perfecting its spells would likely
be hell-bent against letting all that hard work go down the tubes,
losing
it is not an option. The alternative would be to find an alternate
magic
order that also contains fire-based spells, but does not conflict with
the first. This alternate second order may not have as many, or as
desirable,
fire-based spells as the other, but at least it won't conflict with the
mage's original order.</font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><font
 size="+1">Clerics:
The spiritual leaders</font></font></font></u></b></p>
</center>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Every
religion
on Nnet Olotor has its share of <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Cleric">clerics</a>.
In any religious community, the
role of a cleric is to teach the community the ways of their religion,
and to provide them with moral guidance, and thus, clerics are often
seen
as a positive role models. More importantly, the cleric is a
community's
link to his/her religion's worshipped deities. Because of this link,
clerics
often hold high positions of power. Depending on the religion, a cleric
can either appoint people in the community as their city leaders,
military
leaders, and arbiters, or they can hold any or all of these positions
themselves.
In some religious communities, clerical positions are hereditary, while
in others, any extremely loyal and experienced mage can be appointed
cleric
by the religious higher-ups of the community, or by the deities
themselves.
A few communities may even offer suffrage to its worshippers, so the
general
populace can choose their next religious leaders. Religions with small,
isolated tribes often have only one or two local clerics. The larger
organized
religions may have different ranks of clerics, with the lower ranked
clerics
each running a single temple, a middle-ranked cleric being in charge of
all the temples in a city, and a few high ranking clerics who govern
the
entire religion, and who are second only to the deities themselves.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Like a mage,
a
cleric will have access to magic energy, and the ability to cast
spells.
However, there are fundamental differences between these two types of
spellcasters.
Since a cleric usually has a much stronger relationship with the
deities
he/she worships, he/she usually is given greater access the to magic of
the religion. They will be able to learn spells from the magic orders
of
all the deities of the religion, but will not be given access to any
magic
orders outside the religion, even if no religious conflicts exist
between
such orders. Clerics will also be able to learn special clerical spells
that are denied to a standard mage. These special spells are usually
very
powerful, and in most cases, a cleric will have more than enough magic
energy to cast them.</font></font>

who is a direct and unnatural creation
of a deity, and is indistinguishable from a naturally born member of a
race of sentience. Angels are born with the magic energy of a highly
experienced
cleric, but their energy capacity can potentially grow to nearly that
of
a deity. An angel has full access to the magic order of the deity that
created him/her. He/she can cast spells that are normally only open to
the deity, and can single handedly cast spells which normally require
the
collective energy of several spellcasters. However, he/she has to learn
each individual spell on his/her own, as if he/she was a normal person.
Angels are forever bound to the magic order they are born under; they
cannot
gain the magic energy of other deities, and therefore can't learn
spells
from other magic orders.</font></font>
