Blood: Alien Invasion</font></font></font></p>
</center>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; The story of Evil Blood is set on
Nnet
Olotor, sometime after Earth's fall of its Roman Empire, but before its
Scientific Revolution. Nnet Olotor is a dimension chronologically
parallel
to Earth, and is inhabited by a small number of races of sentient
beings,
but until about 20 years ago, bore no humans. These first humans were
pulled
from Earth in some kind of freak accident, either a teleportation spell
gone awry, or by a natural interdimensional phenomenon. Either way, the
new humans convinced the Nnet Olotorians to open a permanent gateway,
so
that the people of both worlds could trade freely. This gesture of
courtesy
of the Nnet Olotorians was to be their potential downfall, and would
change
their way of life forever.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Not long after the permanent
gateway
was opened, a human aristocrat by the name of Alex Stevens, obsessed
with
the extreme wealth of the Nnet Olotorian kingdoms, began a campaign to
conquer these kingdoms, steal whatever he could get his hands on, and
escape
to the safety of Earth. He assembled a small army of about 70 or 80
human
men, and somehow managed to overthrow a major Nnet Olotorian city
state.
I'm not yet exactly sure how Stevens manages to put his army together,
but I am considering a number of possibilities. Stevens is a devout
Christian,
so he will definitely use that to influence others in his faith to
assist
him. Stevens will use this influence to assemble his first army, to
expand
his army after he conquers the city state. He may even claim that he
was
visited by the Christian god himself, and asked to purge Nnet Olotor of
its "ungodly infidels" or something along those lines. This wouldn't be
too hard for him to do so, because of the extreme moral differences
between
people of his faith, and most Nnet Olotorian cultures. Stevens or his
family
may also have ties with the military, and he may be a high ranking
officer
himself with a few forces of his own. His first army could even be a
private
army, or perhaps even hired thugs. As for how Stevens overthrows the
Nnet
Olotorian city state, the most likely scenario I'll go with is Stevens
and his small army posing as friendly visitors to the city, then taking
the city's leaders by surprise and holding them hostage, much like the
Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro did to the Incan leader.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; After Stevens captured the Nnet
Olotorian
city state, he expanded his army significantly and declared war on Nnet
Olotor as well as anyone who stood in the way of his interests. His
army
then began conquering other Nnet Olotorian civilizations, converting
the
Nnet Olotorians to Christianity, raping elven women, enslaving people,
committing genocide, and perhaps they even went as far as to nearly
wipe
out an entire race of people or religious faith. Along the way, Stevens
even had the nerve to proclaim himself 'Emperor'. Conquering Nnet
Olotorian
civilizations would not be easy for the Emperor. Although his army was
growing steadily, it wouldn't be enough for him to pull off any
invasions
against any major Nnet Olotorian strongholds without some kind of
distinct
advantage. The Emperor's army would be at a monumental disadvantage,
because
he would have no spellcasters within his ranks. This is because Nnet
Olotorian
magic is a divine power, controlled and governed by Nnet Olotorian
deities,
and thus, gaining the ability to cast spells requires faith in a Nnet
Olotorian
deity. Emperor Stevens' army is strictly Christian, and he considers
following
any other religion to be heresy. However, he may be able to convince
rogue
Nnet Olotorian nations who do practice magic to assist him, leveling
the
playing field. It's even possible that Stevens brought some things from
Earth that were alien to the Nnet Olotorians, such as horses, certain
military
tactics, or weapons, and was somehow able to use these to his
advantage.
In order for Stevens to bring anything from Earth to Nnet Olotor, he
would
have to seize control of the interdimensional portal. At some point of
his invasion, he takes the gate by force, then builds his heavily
fortified
capitol city around it. I'm not yet sure if the gateway is in the first
city Stevens conquered, or if he took control of it at some later point
of his reign of terror. Not all humans supported Emperor Stevens. Most
of the humans on Nnet Olotor were friendly with the world's natives,
and
grew increasingly uncomfortable with the Emperor's aggressive tactics.
Eventually, they began to actively and openly oppose the Emperor, and
soon
the human armies joined the war and allied themselves with those of
Nnet
Olotor. Not surprisingly, Emperor Stevens labeled the humans who
opposed
him and his interests to be 'race traitors', and vowed to deal with
them
appropriately.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; After Emperor Stevens conquered a
small
number of civilizations, maybe five or six, he had enough wealth to
flee
to Earth and live any way he wanted for the rest of his life. However,
Stevens, blinded by greed, insisted on pushing further into Nnet
Olotor,
and would not be satisfied until he had taken every last item of value
he could get his hands on. This greed proved to be his downfall,
because
it influenced the Nnet Olotorian forces to unleash a desperate,
ultra-powerful
attack on Stevens' capitol city, an attack they had vowed never to use
unless as an absolute last resort, the same way a nuclear superpower
today
might feel about resorting to a nukes. I'm not sure exactly what this
attack
will be. It could be the one, ultimate desperation spell of a deity's
magic
order, it could be a massive swarm of giant, flesh-eating insects, or
it
could even be some kind of divine intervention. Whatever the attack, it
will take the Stevens Empire completely by surprise, leave its capitol
city in a smoldering ruin, and destroy the interdimensional portal, not
only severing the Empire's only supply route from Earth, but preventing
Emperor Stevens from escaping as well. Stevens himself will survive the
attack, either because he was warned in advance to leave the city, or
simply
wasn't there at the time.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Although the attack devastated the
Stevens
Empire, they were still a significant threat to Nnet Olotor. The Empire
was still recruiting any humans they could lure in by taking advantage
of their religious beliefs, and by promising them a piece of whatever
loot
they plundered. The Empire also continued to form new alliances with
rogue
armies by helping them in their interests. Soon, the Empire and their
allies
were soon considered evenly matched with the good forces of Nnet
Olotor.
Of course, the Emperor himself had to remain in hiding from the
hundreds
of thousands of enemies he made during his invasions, but nevertheless,
he was still able to remain in control of his forces. Some time before
or during their crusade, the Stevens Empire had learned about the
existence
of an enchanted artifact known as the Orb of Knowledge. The Orb enabled
people to communicate directly with Nnet Olotor's god of knowledge and
secrets, who could read people's thoughts wherever his magic energy
existed,
and was the only deity on Nnet Olotor who could obtain information in
this
manner. If anyone in the world ever had any knowledge about how to open
another gateway to Earth, the deity would have this knowledge as well.
The Orb was kept in the deity's main temple, was openly accessible to
the
public, and shared its secrets with anyone who touched it. However,
since
the deity of knowledge was of good alignment, he would always deny
certain
knowledge to anyone with evil intentions, and to anyone who tried to
extract
sensitive information on behalf of such people. This would mean that
the
Orb would be useless to the Stevens Empire, because the deity supported
the good armies of Nnet Olotor. But Emperor Stevens wasn't so easily
discouraged.
He knew that the Orb was his key to victory, and if he could somehow
get
the information he needed from the deity, he could open another portal
to Earth, and get a second chance at fulfilling his dream of completely
conquering Nnet Olotor.</font>
