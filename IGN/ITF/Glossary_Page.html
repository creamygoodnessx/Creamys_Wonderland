little

<p><a name="Angel"></a><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"><b><u>Angel</u></b>
- A person who is a direct and unnatural creation of a deity. Some
deities
can create angels at will, usually by magically creating and implanting
them as embryos within the wombs of female hosts. After that, the
angelic
embryo, before and after birth, develops exactly as if it were a normal
member of the race of its host, and will always be indistinguishable
from
a naturally born member of that race.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Angels are
the
same in every way as their chosen races, with one exception. An angel
begins
life with a substantial amount of <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a>, unlike non-angelic <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mages</a>
who have to earn the privilege of obtaining this energy. An angel has
full
access to the <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a> of the deity that created him/her. He/she can cast spells
that
are normally only open to the deity, and can single handily cast spells
which normally require the collective energy of several spellcasters.
However,
he/she has to learn each individual spell on his/her own, as if he/she
was a normal person. Angels are forever bound to the magic order they
are
born under; they cannot gain the magic energy of other deities, and
therefore
can't learn spells from other magic orders. Additional differences
between
angels and non-angels may apply, depending on the angel's purpose of
existence.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Once an
angel is
created, the deity no longer has any direct control over him/her. The
angel's
gender, alignment, and other features that randomly appear in any
non-angel
will likewise randomly appear in the angel, unless certain features are
specifically chosen by the deity. An angel's true heritage is usually
revealed
after he/she either accidentally discovers his/her magic energy, or if
this energy is discovered by a spell of detection. Even after making
this
discovery, the angel still won't know what magic order he/she is bound
to until he/she experiments with spells of the different&nbsp; orders.
In some rare cases, angels go through life and die without ever knowing
their true identity. An angel who discovers that he/she is an angel may
not necessarily choose to support the interests of his/her creator,
especially
if the angel is of a different alignment from that of his/her creator.</font></font><font

<p><a name="Cleric"></a><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"><b><u>Cleric</u></b>
- Every religion on Nnet Olotor has its share of clerics. In any
religious
community, the role of a cleric is to teach the community the ways of
their
religion, and to provide them with moral guidance, and thus, clerics
are
often seen as a positive role models. More importantly, the cleric is a
community's link to his/her religion's worshipped deities. Because of
this
link, clerics often hold high positions of power. Depending on the
religion,
a cleric can either appoint people in the community as their city
leaders,
military leaders, and arbiters, or they can hold any or all of these
positions
themselves. In some religious communities, clerical positions are
hereditary,
while in others, any extremely loyal and experienced mage can be
appointed
cleric by the religious higher-ups of the community, or by the deities
themselves. A few communities even offer suffrage to its worshippers,
so
the general populace can choose their next religious leaders. Religions
with small, isolated tribes often have only one or two local clerics.
The
larger organized religions may have different ranks of clerics, with
the
lower ranked clerics each running a single temple, a middle-ranked
cleric
being in charge of all the temples in a city, and a few high ranking
clerics
who govern the entire religion, and who are second only to the deities
themselves.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Like a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a>,
a cleric will have <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a>, and the ability to cast magic. However, there are
fundamental
differences between these two types of spellcasters. Since a cleric
usually
has a much stronger relationship with the deities he/she worships,
he/she
usually is given greater access the to magic of the religion. They will
be able to learn spells from the <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
orders</a> of all the deities of the religion, but will not be given
access
to any magic orders outside the religion, even if no religious
conflicts
exist between such orders. Clerics will also be able to learn special
clerical
spells that are denied to a standard mage. These special spells are
usually
very powerful, and in most cases, a cleric will have more than enough
magic
energy to cast them.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<p><a name="Mage"></a><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><b><u>Mage</u></b>
- A sentient being who learns and uses magic spells. Magic is a divine
power, and before a mage can cast any spells, he/she must earn the
ability
to have his/her body absorb his/her deity's <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a> from Nnet Olotor's energy field. A mage is responsible for
supporting
the interests of the deity he/she worships, as well as serving his/her
religion and its worshippers.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><a name="Magic_Energy"></a><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"><b><u>Magic
energy</u></b> - 20,000 years ago, as the earliest people of Nnet
Olotor
began forming their religous beliefs, a strange energy field of unknown
origin was introduced to the world. This energy field was somehow able
to reshape itself in the form of the many gods and godesses that the
worlds'
civilizations came to believe in. After their creation, the deities
began
emitting energy of their own, which spread to every part of the world,
from the shortest blade of grass, to as far into the sky as the eye
could
see. Each of Nnet Olotor's deities controls and governs his/her own
catagory
of magic energy, known as a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a>. Magic energy resides within the bodies of a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mages</a>,
and makes it possible for them to cast spells. The ability of a mage's
body to take in magic energy is a privilege that must be earned through
a series of tests sanctioned by the mage's religion. If the mage passes
these tests, he/she is bestowed the magic energy of his/her deity by
the
deity himself/herself, often in person.</font></font><font

<p><a name="Magic_Order"></a><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"><b><u>Magic
order</u></b> - A category of Nnet Olotor's <a

energy</a>, created and governed by a deity, in which privileged people
can cast a pre-determined set of spells that are appropriate to that
deity.
The strength of a magic order depends on how many people believe in its
deity, and how loyal they are to the deity and his/her interests. The
stronger
a magic order, the more powerful its spells will be when cast by its <a
