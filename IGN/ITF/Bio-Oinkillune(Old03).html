<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
is a
young teenage elf who was abandoned by his mother as an infant. He was
adopted by a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">gwahrai</a>
couple from his infancy, and lives with them in their home in a village
in the woods. He is someone with a high degree of ethical standards,
and
puts the needs of others ahead of his own, often going out of his way
to
help total strangers in need without expecting anything in return.
Despite
being drastically physically different from his gwahrai peers, he has
no
trouble fitting into their society, and has become an excellent tree
climber
despite not having a tail or hands for feet. He values the well being
of
his family and community over all things. Oinkillune has a somewhat
feminine
personality, and because of his high voice, slender frame, and
sometimes
girly mannerisms, he's often mistaken by strangers for a girl. He has a
gentleman-like and magnetic personality, tends to get along with
everyone
he meets, and never looks down upon people.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
considers
his biggest challenge to be looking after his 13 year old
(approximately
nine in human years) sister
<a href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Binky%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Binky</a>.
Binky is exceptionally curious, even by gwahrai standards, and does not
know the difference between an act of bravery and a foolish risk. She
is
extremely reckless and must be watched at all times in order to be kept
out of harm's way. Binky's reckless actions have included things like
challenging
predatory beasts to one-on-one fights, and attempting dangerous stunts,
but her brother has always been fortunate enough to consistently save
Binky
from her own suicidal nature.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Binky is not
Oinkillune's
only concern in life. Although the gwahrai who raised Oinkillune are a
peaceful community, they are no strangers to violence. They constantly
live under the threat of not only attacks from the predatory beasts
that
regularly try to feed on them, but also from the occasional invasion
from
rogue states. Like most of the members of his adopted race, Oinkillune
carries a gwahrai thornstick and sling with him at all times, and is
always
ready to join his community in defending the village should such an
emergency
arise. However, despite bearing the responsibility of defending his
community,
Oinkillune always doubted if he could ever bring himself to use his
weapons
for lethal force if he needed to. He is someone who shuns violence,
preferring
to reason with his enemies, and only uses violence when absolutely
necessary.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Until
recently,
Oinkillune viewed all races of people as being generally good, despite
having their small share of evil members. However, something happened
to
his community that would forever change the way he felt about the human
race. A few years ago, the Stevens Empire began expanding their army.
Because
the interdimensional portal had recently been shut down by Nnet
Olotor's
good armies, the empire needed vast quantities of building materials to
maintain and expand their army. One of these materials was wood, and in
order to obtain the amount they needed, the empire began to clear cut
the
forest the gwahrai depended on for survival. When the gwahrai realized
the empire's clear cutting campaign was headed towards their villages,
they attacked the empire, driving them away from the forest. However,
the
Stevens Empire soon returned with a vengeance. Several hundred imperial
troops stormed the forest, killing everything in sight, and laying
torch
to the trees in an effort to burn the gwahrai from their hiding places.
With the help of their elven allies, and perhaps even a bit of divine
intervention,
the gwahrai were able to defeat the invaders, but the price of victory
was high. Nearly half of the gwahrai homes were destroyed, and several
hundred gwahrai and elves perished, including some of Oinkillune's
closest
friends. As a result of the attack, Oinkillune developed a deep hatred
towards the human race, not just the Stevens Empire, and only the few
good
humans he has met on occasion prevents him from thinking that the
entire
race is inherently and totally evil.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
decided
to learn as much as he could about the Stevens Empire, and like most
Nnet
Olotorians, he keeps track of the war between the empire and Nnet
Olotor.
However, he never bothered to learn too much about Earthen culture and
traditions outside of those of the empire. From the time Oinkillune
first
heard about the war, he had assumed that the evil ways of the Stevens
Empire
was the norm for the entire human race. During his travels, Oinkillune
avoids human cities whenever he can, since he assumes that such places
are hotbeds of violent crime. Since his contact with humans is very
limited,
he has never bothered to learn their languages. Still, when Oinkillune
deals with unfamiliar but seemingly friendly Elven speaking humans, he
tries to put his prejudices aside and let his true, courteous nature
shine
through.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; In the years
following
the attack against his adopted people, Oinkillune developed a strong
hatred
towards bullies and people who use their power (political power, size,
etc.) to forcefully bend others to their will. He never backs down to a
bully, nor does he allow anyone to talk down to him, but his hatred
often
clouds his judgment so that he forgets when he's overmatched. Other
than
this desire to preserve his pride, he does not suffer any other lapses
in his judgment when it comes to violent confrontations, and respects
his
physical limitations. Even though his contempt for violence has not
wavered,
he won't hesitate to use it if need be. However, Oinkillune still
doubts
that he could ever use lethal force if he had to, and never carries his
thornstick with the thorn attached.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; At a very
early
age, perhaps when he was around 12 years old, Oinkillune discovered
that
he bore </font><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a><font color="#ff8080">.
He was told that since he had never attempted to earn any deity's magic
energy, the presence of such energy within him could only mean that he
was an <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Angel">angel</a>.
Because he was born around the same time as the birth of the Zodian
angels,
it was highly likely that he was one of those angels. Despite the
widespread
rumor that Zodian angels are inherently evil, the gwahrai community
decided
to judge Oinkillune by his good nature, and did not treat him as a
pariah.
In order to help conceal his identity, Oinkillune's family suggested to
him that he should pass himself off as a </font><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a><font
 color="#ff8080">
who earned a good deity's magic energy. Although he was able to easily
pass as a mage, he saw Zod's energy as a curse and a disease, and
always
had nightmares about it consuming his soul, and turning him into a
monster
that would commit unimaginable acts of evil. He had always refrained
from
using his magic energy in any way until the destruction of his village
at the hands of the Stevens Empire. It was then when he decided to take
his fighting skills to the next level. Training under experienced
fighting
mages, Oinkillune began using his magic energy to enhance his fighting
prowess, and learned a few magic techniques along the way. Because he
was
an angel, Oinkillune possessed a tremendous amount of magic energy, and
had fighting potential far surpassing that of a normal elf. Despite
standing
just over five feet in height and weighing a mere 105 pounds, he had
the
power to single handily bring down a small group of mid-sized humans
within
the first few years of beginning his training. Realizing the power he
possessed,
Oinkillune used it to dedicate his life to fighting evil and protecting
the innocent, and to hopefully contribute in the destruction of the
Stevens
Empire. He vowed never to learn or cast any of the actual spells in the
</font><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a><font color="#ff8080"> he was bound to, since it would mean
supporting
the interests of the evil deity who created him. Oinkillune hopes to
someday
find a way to purge Zod's magic energy from his body, and to earn the
magic
energy of a deity whose ideals match his own.</font></font><font
