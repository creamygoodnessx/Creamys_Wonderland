<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Zod never
completely
ran himself out of </font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font

 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080">, and therefore, never really died. Instead,
he was forced into a mortal shell which bore the likeness of whatever
his
worshippers believed him to look like. When he cast the spell that
created
his </font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Angel">angels</a></font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">, he saved the last bit
of magic energy to keep him alive when
he retreated into his physical body. Since Zod is one of Nnet Olotor's
evil deities, he gains magic energy whenever his worshippers pay homage
to him by committing acts of evil, which usually take the form of the
sacrifice
of a person. Normally, Zod can only gain magic energy when his
followers
commit such acts. However, when he was trapped in his physical body, he
could gain magic energy from any violent death on Nnet Olotor,
regardless
of who was responsible for any such death. Despite this tremendous
advantage
to his interests, Zod only used took a bodily form as a last resort for
three important reasons. First, while in his physical body, Zod would
no
longer be able to keep a constant eye on his worshippers (an ability
that
many other deities have), thus limiting his communicative abilities to
person to person contact. Second, his </font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080"><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080"> would be significantly
weaker, dramatically decreasing the effectiveness of the spells his
worshippers
cast. Also, because Zod's magic energy was now eminating from a single
point (Zod's body), rather than uniformly from all over the planet, his
magic order got weaker as it got further away from his fortress. Third
and most importantly, as a mortal, Zod would be subject to every means
of death as any mortal creature, and if he was killed while in his
physical
body, he would be permanently destroyed along with his magic order. In
order to return to full strength, Zod would need tens of thousands of
violent
deaths, and once this is achieved, he would only need the blood of one
of his angels to return to his deity form, giving him another chance to
wreak havoc on Nnet Olotor. Although violent deaths on Nnet Oloter give
Zod strength, they are not necessary for him to ultimately return to
his
deity form. Zod could opt to abandon his physical body before he
reaches
full strength, but it would mean having to then get his magic energy
back
solely by rebuilding his religious community, wasting the violent
deaths
as part of his plan.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Besides his
lack
of magic power, Zod also faced a different problem. During the war
against
Nnet Olotor's good armies, a great majority of his followers had been
killed.
Because Zod, like any other deity, relies on the number and loyalty of
his worshippers not only to maintain the power of his magic order, but
also to stay alive while he's in his deity form, he would need to
reestablish
his religious community before his return to his deity form. If Zod
does
not have a considerable base of followers by the time of his return to
his deity form, he will gradually lose magic energy after his return,
until
the amount of his energy once again matches the energy the number and
loyalty
of his worshippers can provide. I'll have to come up with a way for his
followers to start some kind of recruiting campaign to attract new
worshippers.
I'm not sure how to do this, but the current situation with the Al
Quiada
may give me a few pointers.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Because 90
percent
of Zod's army had been wiped out, he obviously would have a hard time
converting
new worshippers, let alone having them carry out the tens of thousands
of deaths he needed to return to full strength. However, Zod had
anticipated
this setback long before his defeat, and since then had come up with a
countermeasure. Right after his defeat, he had his followers start a
false
rumor throughout Nnet Olotor's civilizations that any one of his angels
were inherently evil, and could resurrect the evil deity if they chose
to do so, and only they knew how to do it. It was Zod's hope that this
rumor would trigger a public witch hunting campaign in which enough
people
would be killed to satisfy Zod's kill quota. The public is not aware of
the existence of Zod's physical body, the advantages it gives him, or
even
the fact that he's still alive. If they were, they would not hunt down
Zod's children, but would rather go after Zod himself. So needless to
say,
the existence of Zod's physical body is a secret that Zod only shares
with
his most trusted worshippers.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; However,
things
didn't go exactly according to Zod's plan. Most of the elves were
appalled
at the idea of killing their own children, even though they 'knew' what
the alternative was. Instead, they searched for ways to purge the evil
they were led to believe was lurking within their children. However, to
Zod's good fortune, one Nnet Olotorian faction was not so
compassionate,
and felt they needed to do whatever it took to stop Zod from once again
defiling their world. So they began to hunt down the children of Zod
themselves,
managing to slaughter around 300 of their targets, along with the
people
trying to defend them. The genocidal faction was eventually stopped,
and
as punishment for their actions, was banished from the mainland.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Although the
deity
of knowledge could read the thoughts and secrets of everyone on Nnet
Olotor,
he could not read those of other deities. This made it possible for Zod
to keep his secrets safe from the god of knowledge, including whatever
plans he had for his return to power. However, Zod would eventually
have
to tell at least a few of his followers about his secret if they were
to
carry out his plans, risking discovery. Long before he ever had to
worry
about being overthrown, he had his followers build a fortress in an
uninhabited
and isolated part of the world, and had them install magic inhibitors
throughout
the building. These inhibitors were designed to block out the magic
energy
of all deities except Zod, so that only his magic order could exist
within
the building. Because the god of knowledge's mind reading ability
required
any recipients to be in contact with his own magic energy, he could not
pick up the thoughts of anyone within the boundaries of Zod's fortress,
making it the ideal place for Zodians to hold secret meetings. Needless
to say, Zod never told anyone about his most classified information
until
the completion of the fortress. Zod did not worry about the god of
knowledge
discovering the truth about his plans for his return to the deity form.
The false rumors Zod was spreading throughout Nnet Olotor in order to
incite
its population to hunt down and kill his angels also fooled the deity
of
knowledge. This is because the deity of knowledge's only information
about
the mortal world was what he read from people's thoughts, and the only
people who knew the truth were confined within the walls of Zod's
fortress.
Also, any campaign to destroy the Orb of Knowledge would be in vain,
because
its deity can always create a new one in its place.</font></font><font

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ffccff">5/20/2003 - </font><font
 color="#cc66cc">About
a week ago, I came up with a new idea for Evil Blood's plot, an idea
that
might have been influenced by DragonBall Z. I was thinking about the
kinds
of spells that might be appropriate for the Zodian magic
order. They would have to be spells that only someone who is evil would
normally cast, and could be based on death, anguish, and suffering. I
thought
of a few ideas for spells, most if not all of them already exist in
Dungeons
and Dragons. One of these ideas included a giant symbol that would
immediately
kill anyone who looked directly at it. Then, I remembered a particular
episode of DBZ in which a super-powerful villain called Majin Buu wiped
out most of the Earth's human population with a single attack which he
called the Human Extinction Attack. I thought that such a technique
would
be perfect for Zod's magic order, so I decided to put my own spin on
it.
Eventually, I came up with a possible spell called the Global
Extinction
spell, that would kill all members of a chosen species throughout the
world.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; I soon
realized
that I could apply such a spell to Evil Blood's story. After the
Stevens
Empire gains a significant foothold on Nnet Olotor, some of the world's
good armies may feel that all humans are inherently evil, and must be
wiped
off the face of the planet altogether. Desperate, they may turn to the
Global Extinction spell in order to achieve their goal. However, the
spell
exists only in the Zodian magic order. As you can imagine, the Global
Extinction
spell is one of Zod's most powerful spells, and demands an unimaginable
amount of magic energy to cast, and even 28 years after Zod's defeat,
there
still may not be enough magic energy in the entire order to cast such a
spell. So any party seeking to use this method to purge the humans from
Nnet Olotor may try to help Zod's magic order regain its former level
of
power. This idea is not yet being officially implemented into EB's
plot,
and I'm not sure if it ever will be, but it just gives me something to
think about.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
