<p>> Later on in the story, Stardancer touches the Orb of Knowledge, and
finds out who and what she is. Word had spread to the Stevens Empire about
the Plant Queen, and her willingness to do favors in exchange for new lifeforms.
The empire desperately needed to extract the information from the Orb of
Knowledge that would allow them to create another permanent portal to Earth,
so their reinforcements could pass through. Emperor Stevens sent a few
of his troops on a boat filled with various Earthen animals to visit the
Plant Queen. The Queen was impressed by the animals she would be adding
to her 'memory', and in exchange, granted the empire's request to help
them retrieve the desired information from the Orb. So she created Stardancer,
a person of almost pure good, and specifically engineered her mind to get
around the Orb's 'firewalls' so she could find out how to create the portal.
(I haven't decided exactly what the Plant Queen put in Stardancer's mind
to allow her to fool the Orb, in fact, I'm not sure if knowing that is
important.) The Queen instructed her visitors to escort Stardancer to the
Orb, then after she retrieves the desired information, to take her back
to the Queen to be absorbed. This would allow the Plant Queen to acquire
all of Stardancer's memories, memories the Queen would then pass on to
the Stevens Empire.
<p>> Creating a being of nearly pure good would inevitably cause certain
complications for a mission of this nature. After touching the Orb, it
would be highly likely that Stardancer would refuse to cooperate with the
empire, since doing so would spell the end of Nnet Olotor. The God of Knowledge
might even make Stardancer aware of what she is, and unlock her abilities
as a angel of the Plant Queen. If Stardancer used these abilities to turn
on the empire and escape, they would probably be powerless to stop her.
As a counter-measure, the Plant Queen created a few angels who were to
subdue Stardancer if she were to resist.
<p>> However, the empire's plan suffered disastrous failure. On their way
back to the mainland, while the other Plant Queen angels and most of the
ship's crew were asleep, Stardancer wandered up to the deck and somehow
fell overboard. She later washed shore where she was found by our heroes.
When the ship's crew found out what happened to their precious cargo, they
decided to proceed to temple where the Orb was housed, under the assumption
that Stardancer would show up to discover her identity. They planned to
wait until after Stardancer's session with the God of Knowledge to pounce
on their victim, then take her back to her creator.&nbsp; I will most likely
have Stardancer killed before the end of the story.
