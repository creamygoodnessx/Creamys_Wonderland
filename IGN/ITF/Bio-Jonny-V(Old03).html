<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Genevieve
Alexandria
Stevens is the daughter of Earthen conqueror Emperor Stevens. She once
had the potential of being a nice and sociable person, but an unkind
childhood
changed all that. Genevieve grew up in the Stevens Empire, a society
dominated
by idealism, in which its members are judged primarily by their social
class, gender, and physical appearance. She did not fit the empire's
ideals
as a good looking young lady, and was given a very hard time for it
from
most of the people she knew, mainly her father and his elitist peers.
(The
ideal look for a woman in the Steven's Empire is to have a tall and
slender
body, and a youthful appearance, but Genevieve was a short and very
heavy
set girl in her pre-adolescence.)&nbsp; The empire is also heavily
male-oriented,
in which men get to make all the important decisions and hold positions
of power, while women are meant to be seen and not heard, and are given
far fewer rights than male counterparts. Genevieve refused to accept
herself
as an inferior, and always questioned the empire's gender biased views.
She repeatedly did things that were only acceptable for men to do, such
as carrying a weapon, and wearing certain male attire, which earned her
further resentment. Because the Stevens Empire looked down on the
practice
of magic as witchcraft, Genevieve's open fascination with magic only
made
her even more of an outcast. Noone in Genevieve's childhood showed any
compassion towards her, nor did they ever take anything she said or did
seriously. Whenever she tried to speak her mind in a serious manner, it
was always passed off as a joke. Her father didn't even care that she
stood
in the war room and listened in on his private military meetings with
his
generals, top military advisors, and his Zodian allies, and he never
thought
that Genevieve might someday turn on him. Genevieve spent her early
years
toeing the line for her father and peers, and did everything she could
to please them, but all she ever got in return was disdain and
ungratefulness.
Whenever Genevieve tried to resolve a personal dispute with her father
in a diplomatic and peaceful way, her efforts would always be thrown
back
in her face with hostility, and her father would remind her of how
worthless
she was. Every time such an incident occurred, it would stick into her
memory for life, and permanently erode her ever diminishing good nature.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Genevieve's
only
salvation came in the form of an elven slave named Kailaynah who, like
Genevieve, was an outcast to society, simply because of his race and
social
status. Because the two were outcasts, it wasn't difficult for them to
form a strong emotional bond. When Genevieve was nine, she stood up for
Kailaynah and protected him from a beating from his cruel owners. In
return,
Kailaynah secretly spent his free time teaching her how to speak, read,
and write his language as a sign of gratitude. Although Kailaynah could
speak English, he had a strong accent from his native language, which
was
Nnet Olotor's most common elven language. As a result, he kept
mispronouncing
Genevieve's name as "Johnny V". Genevieve took advantage of her new
language
abilities by reading elven literature and history. She also looked up
everything
she could about Nnet Olotor's various <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
orders</a>, and what she could do to someday become a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a>
herself. However, the Stevens Empire forbids the use of magic by law,
and
the penalty for violating this law is death. So, at the age of 12,
Genevieve
finally mustered up the courage to defect from the empire, to pursue
her
lifelong dream of becoming a mage. I'm not yet sure what happened to
Kailaynah.
It's possible that Emperor Stevens brutally murdered him, because he
discovered
the truth and felt that he was corrupting his daughter, and that was
the
final straw that pushed Genevieve to leave home. Or perhaps Genevieve
saw
a once in a lifetime opportunity to help him to escape the empire, and
decided it was a good idea for her to leave as well. This part is still
very much up in the air.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; When
Genevieve
Stevens defected from the Stevens Empire, she officially adopted the
name
"Jonny-V", because that was the name she answered to from the only
person
who ever respected her. Now that she was no longer a part of the
Stevens
Empire, people around her no longer treated her like a pariah. However,
the damage to her goodwill had already been done by the abuse from her
father and his peers. Because she was no longer under the empire's
restrictive
heel, Jonny-V could pursue her lifelong dream to become a mage, and
wasted
no time in doing so. Because of her hard work and fascination for the
art
of magic, it wasn't long before she was granted a bit of <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a> of her own. (I'm not yet sure what magic order Jonny-V
joins,
but it will most likely be controlled by a neutral deity, and contains
an variety of very destructive spells.) Her ultimate goal soon became
to
train herself into an unstoppable fighter, and to someday
single-handedly
bring down her father's empire, once and for all avenging everything he
and his acquaintances did to her.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Right after
she
became a mage, Jonny-V began traveling throughout Nnet Olotor as a
drifter,
constantly practicing her combat and magic skills, and looking for new
ways to test her limits. Unfortunately, this practicing is often done
at
the expense of anyone who gets in her way or confronts her. As
Jonny-V's
past abuse by her father and his acquaintances diminished her
innocence,
she built an emotional wall around herself in order to cope with it. At
the time, she was afraid to talk back to them, because she knew what
they
were capable of, so she was forced to keep her emotions bottled up.
Jonny-V
is constantly haunted by the fact she didn't retaliate against them
when
she had a chance, but does so vicariously through other people with her
violent and explosive personality. She picks a fight at every chance
she
gets, and never, ever backs down from one. She takes every opportunity
she can to oppose powerful enemies and increase her fighting skills.
She
wins fights more often than she loses them, and becomes more powerful
whatever
the outcome. As Jonny-V's power increased, so did her boldness. She
began
traveling to places where she knows security is tight, and then causing
trouble in order to draw the attention of the law enforcers. She then
engages
the police in battle, and usually ends up killing or incapacitating all
who try to stop her. But after being nearly killed in battle on a few
occasions,
Jonny-V has become more selective in her battles, only choosing fights
she feels she can win. Jonny-V has developed a thirst for mortal combat
and takes great pleasure in killing her opponents. However, if an
opponent
puts up a sufficiently good fight, Jonny-V may choose to spare him/her
so that he/she can give Jonny-V another good fight in the future.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Despite
Jonny-V's
evil nature and apparent lack of conscience, she does have her own code
of ethics that she doesn't expect anyone else to understand. She
considers
the only acceptable means to die is in battle at the hands of a
superior
opponent. She considers herself to be a courageous warrior, and
despises
cowardice. As brutal and bloodthirsty as she is, she would never sneak
attack her enemies, and only kills someone after engaging them in
combat.
Jonny-V secretly wants to return to her nice and trusting self, but
doesn't
know if she'll ever be able to work up the courage to do so, despite
her
boldness in combat. She refuses to be nice to anyone in fear of someone
taking advantage of her goodwill, like those during her childhood did.
Because her trust was repeatedly trampled on during her days in the
Empire,
she has vowed to never trust anyone again. Besides, she figures that
she's
already made too bad of a reputation for herself for anyone to be
friends
with her anyway.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Jonny-V is
currently
an above average fighter and an exceptionally powerful mage for someone
who has been in the practice for less that four years. She hasn't
learned
a lot of spells in her magic order, but she has nearly mastered the few
she does know, and makes them very powerful. She has also learned a few
magic techniques, some of which she developed herself. Jonny-V takes
her
combat and magic skills very seriously, because they are all she ever
trusts.
She knows she will most likely confront her father or his empire at
some
point in time, and she's willing to do whatever it takes to prepare
herself
for such a battle. Besides gaining power through combat experience, she
occasionally searches for ways to learn new spells in her magic order,
usually by reading literature about her magic order, and vigorously
practicing
any new spells she learns. I may even have her enter some kind of
fighting
tournament, in order to test herself against some of the world's best
fighters.
Jonny-V is proficient in small blades, such as daggers and throwing
knives,
and also in long polearms. Her weapon of choice is a lightly enchanted
staff, which has a foot-long blade at one end, and possibly an magic
gem
just behind the blade. I'm not yet sure how Jonny-V acquires such a
weapon,
but it will most likely be a prize won from a defeated enemy.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; The story
begins
with Jonny-V adventuring on her own, before she met <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Oinkillune</a>
and <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Binky%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Binky</a>.
At beginning of the story, I will try to focus on Jonny-V's
personality,
give hints as to why she's always pissed off, and how she came to be
that
way. I will also focus on her level of fighting skills, reveal a few of
her attacks, and her ferocity in battle. When Jonny-V finally does meet
Oinkillune, she will inadvertantly or reluctantly save his life, that
of
Binky's, or both. One of the <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">gwahrai</a>s'
cultural laws states that if anyone saves the life of a gwahrai, that
gwahrai
becomes obligated to accompany his/her rescuer until he/she returns the
deed. Jonny-V is vehimently opposed to the two joining her, because she
feels that they would be a liability in her quest to overthrow her
father's
empire. Oinkillune is equally opposed to the arrangement, because he is
extremely uncomfortable with Jonny-V's violent and hostile nature.
However,
he agrees to leave the forest for the first time in his life in order
to
honor is adopted people's traditions. Jonny-V reluctantly agrees with
letting
Oinkillune and Binky tag along, but threatens the two with bodily harm
if they ever get in her way. Because it is against her code of ethics
to
just kill the two, she tries other means of getting them off her back
throughout
the next few chapters, all without success. However, once Jonny-V sees
Oinkillune in battle, she is amazed at his skills, and immediately
figures
out that he's a Zodian <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Angel">angel</a>.
Realizing that Oinkillune has a fighting potential that far exceeds
that
of her own, Jonny-V gains a newfound respect for the young gwahrai elf,
and accepts him as her ally.</font></font>
