<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Binky is a
preteen
gwahrai who lives in a treetop village in the middle of a forest close
to Nnet Olotor's equator. She is a high-spirited bundle of energy who
does
not seem to have an "off switch". She is exceptionally curious, even by
gwahrai standards, and has a natural flair for adventure. This
curiosity
often gets her into trouble, because she often sneaks away from the
safety
of the village to explore the wilderness alone, sometimes getting
herself
into life-threatening situations. In such cases, her adopted brother
Oinkillune
has to find her, rescue her if necessary, and then escort her home.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; But sneaking
out
of town isn't the only kind of trouble Binky gets herself into. She is
extremely reckless and does not understand the difference between acts
of courage and foolish risks. She regularly tries to 'prove' her
supposed
bravery by performing dangerous stunts. Sometimes, Binky and her
friends
like to anger dangerous wild animals, and provoke the animals into
attacking
them. (This could be a gwahrai equivalent of 'cow-tipping'.) Binky also
loves to perform stunts in public, including demonstrating her 'escape
artist' skills. There may be instances where Binky's stunts went
horribly
wrong, and would have resulted in her death if Oinkillune hadn't jumped
in and saved her. But no matter how many times Binky barely escapes
death
from her foolish stunts, she doesn't appear to learn from her ways, and
keeps getting into trouble over and over again.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Until
recently,
Binky was a compulsive thief, and has shoplifted from stores and stands
in various towns and cities. She also developed a knack for picking
pockets
in crowded environments, sometimes being able to steal enchanted items
from powerful warriors. However, when Binky was last caught stealing
over
a year ago, her family decided that they'd had enough of the shame she
brought upon them, and forbade her from traveling outside the village
until
she learned her lesson. Since then, Binky has apparently put an end to
her dishonest ways, and has given up shoplifting and pick-pocketing
altogether.</font></font>
