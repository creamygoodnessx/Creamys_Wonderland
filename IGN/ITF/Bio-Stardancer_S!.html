<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Later on in the story, Stardancer
touches
the Orb of Knowledge, and finds out who and what she is. Word had
spread
to the Stevens Empire about the Plant Queen, and her willingness to do
favors in exchange for new lifeforms. The empire desperately needed to
extract the information from the Orb of Knowledge that would allow them
to create another permanent portal to Earth, so their reinforcements
could
pass through. Emperor Stevens sent a few of his troops on a boat filled
with various Earthen animals to visit the Plant Queen. The Queen was
impressed
by the animals she would be adding to her 'memory', and in exchange,
granted
the empire's request to help them retrieve the desired information from
the Orb. So she created Stardancer, a person of almost pure good, and
specifically
engineered her mind to get around the Orb's 'firewalls' so she could
find
out how to create the portal. (I haven't decided exactly what the Plant
Queen put in Stardancer's mind to allow her to fool the Orb. In fact,
I'm
not sure if knowing that is important.) The Queen instructed her
visitors
to escort Stardancer to the Orb, then after she retrieves the desired
information,
to take her back to the Queen to be absorbed. This would allow the
Plant
Queen to acquire all of Stardancer's memories, memories the Queen would
then pass on to the Stevens Empire.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Creating a being of nearly pure
good
would inevitably cause certain complications for a mission of this
nature.
After touching the Orb, it would be highly likely that Stardancer would
refuse to cooperate with the empire, since doing so would spell the end
of Nnet Olotor. The God of Knowledge might even make Stardancer aware
of
what she is, and unlock her abilities as an angel of the Plant Queen.
If
Stardancer used these abilities to turn on the empire and escape, they
would probably be powerless to stop her. As a counter-measure, the
Plant
Queen created a few angels who were to subdue Stardancer if she were to
resist.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; However, the empire's plan
suffered disastrous
failure. On their way back to the mainland, while the other Plant Queen
angels and most of the ship's crew were asleep, Stardancer wandered up
to the deck and somehow fell overboard. She later washed ashore where
she
was found by our heroes. When the ship's crew found out what happened
to
their precious cargo, they decided to proceed to temple where the Orb
was
housed, under the assumption that Stardancer would show up to discover
her identity. They planned to wait until after Stardancer's session
with
the God of Knowledge to pounce on their victim, then take her back to
her
creator.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

Fate of Stardancer</font></font></font></u></b></p>

<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; I'm not yet sure what will happen
to
Stardancer. Originally, I wanted to have her give herself willingly to
the Plant Queen in order to save the life of her friends. I haven't
ruled
out that possibility just yet, but here's something else I'm
considering.
When the Plant Queen created Stardancer, she intended her to live for
only
about a week, which would have been just enough time for her to get to
the Orb of Knowledge, retrieve the information she needed, and then be
brought back to the Plant Queen. Stardancer was never meant to live out
a full and normal life, and she only has a life span of a few months,
just
like any other one of the Plant Queen's angels.</font><font

</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; As Stardancer nears the end of her
life,
and her plant angel body begins to wilt, </font><font

start looking
for ways to extend the life of their friend. Jonny-V knows of a certain
spell that can change one lifeform into another type of lifeform. But
she
can't cast the spell, because it's not part of her magic order.
However,
she and Oinkillune know of a powerful mage who does know the spell.
This
mage owes the party a favor, because they helped him during a previous
episode of Evil Blood. The mage says that he has never heard of anyone
using the spell on an angelic being before, and doesn't know what
effect
it will have on Stardancer. The mage plans to use the spell to turn
Stardancer
into a true human, and if the spell is successful, Stardancer should
lose
all of her supernatural abilities, since she won't be a plant angel
anymore.
Also, she will be just as vulnerable as a true human, as her wounds
will
no longer instantly heal, and she will no longer be able to regenerate
lost limbs. She will also age just as any normal human would, and she
can
be hurt and killed just like any normal human.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; The mage casts the spell on
Stardancer,
successfully transforming her into a true human, and she feels
rejuvenated
and healthy again. However, the spell has an unexpected effect on her.
As expected, Stardancer has lost her shape-shifting and super-healing
abilities,
and she has become as fragile as a true human. But strangely enough,
she
hasn't lost her emotion-reading abilities. In fact, her telepathic
abilities
have actually improved. Not only can Stardancer still read emotions,
but
she also seems to have gained full mind-reading abilities, and the
ability
to communicate telepathically with others. At first, noone could
explain
her increase in telepathic abilities. But then, Jonny-V remembered that
when the party had met Margo Angle's family on their way to the Orb of
Knowledge, the family mentioned that Margo had full telepathic
abilities,
and wondered why Margo's (Stardancer's) abilities had been reduced to
emotion-reading
only. As it turns out, the Plant Queen modeled Stardancer after Margo
down to the last physical detail. All plant angels have the ability to
read emotions, but for some reason, their telepathic abilities can't go
beyond that. Therefore, when Stardancer was created, she was an exact
physical
copy of Margo, but the only thing holding back her full telepathy was
her
plant angel body. Once Stardancer was turned into a true human, the
loss
of her plant angel body unlocked her full telepathic abilities.</font>
