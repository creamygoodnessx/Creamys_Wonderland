<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
is a
young teenage elf who was adopted by a gwahrai couple from his infancy,
and lives with them in their home in a village in the woods. He is
someone
with a high degree of ethical standards, and puts the needs of others
ahead
of his own, often going out of his way to help total strangers in need
without expecting anything in return. Despite being drastically
physically
different from his gwahrai peers, he has no trouble fitting into their
society, and has become an excellent tree climber despite not having a
tail or hands for feet. He values the well being of his family and
community
over all things, even though he has yet to fully appreciate what they
mean
to him. Oinkillune has a somewhat feminine personality, and because of
his high voice, slender frame, and sometimes girly mannerisms, he's
often
mistaken by strangers for a girl. He has a gentleman-like and magnetic
personality, tends to get along with everyone he meets, and never looks
down upon people.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
considers
his biggest challenge to be looking after his 13 year old
(approximately
nine in human years) sister Binky. Binky is exceptionally curious, even
by gwahrai standards, and does not know the difference between an act
of
bravery and a foolish risk. She is extremely reckless and must be
watched
at all times in order to be kept out of harm's way. Binky's reckless
actions
have included things like challenging predatory beasts to one-on-one
fights,
and attempting dangerous stunts, but her brother has always been
fortunate
enough to consistently save Binky from her own suicidal nature.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Until
recently,
Oinkillune was a staunch pacifist and shunned violence, and never had
to
resort to it. In the village where he lived, pacifism is not an unwise
lifestyle, since a great majority of the community's population have
good
ethics and respond well to reason. He had always felt uneasy carrying
around
his gwahrai thornstick and sling.</font><font color="#ff0000">Like most
of the other residents of the village, he learned to use these two
weapons
as part of his adopted people's tradition, but never took armed combat
seriously and doubted if he could bring himself to use them for lethal
force if he needed to.</font><font color="#ff8080"> However, Oinkillune
suffered a traumatic event three years ago that would forever change
his
pacifist ways. While traveling one day with Binky, the two were
confronted
by a small group of human thugs who demanded their money. Having never
been in a violent confrontation, Oinkillune basically told the thugs to
behave themselves and go home, as if they were some of the small
children
who made trouble back in the village. (He made this demand in Elven,
since
he assumed the thugs could not speak his native Gwahrai, and since he
didn't
speak any English.) The thugs attacked Oinkillune and nearly killed
him,
but Binky managed to throw down a smokestick she had been carrying,
which
allowed her and her brother to escape. (Where Binky got the smokestick
and how she learned to use it is another issue altogether, and is
something
which will be explained on her character page.) (I may or may not
eventually
change the traumatic scenario to some other type of violent encounter,
but the impact is has on Oinkillune will be the same.)</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Before the
incident,
Oinkillune had regularly heard stories about violent criminals, but had
always refused to believe that anyone could actually be capable of that
kind of violence, and had always adhered to his belief that pacifism
was
the best solution to all confrontations. For the first time in his
life,
he began to understand and accept how dangerous people can be, and that
sometimes it's necessary to fight back, but he still had yet to fathom
the true extremes of evil a person can posses, such as the evil within
Zod and Emperor Stevens. He used the incident to warn the people in his
community to not make the same mistake he made in denying the existence
of evil, and reminded them that self defense is a life saving skill
that
should never be taken lightly. In an effort to make up for neglecting
his
self defense skills, Oinkillune began taking his fighting skills a lot
more seriously with not only the gwahrai weapons he grew up with, but
with
a few elven weapons that gwahrai commonly use as well, and even went as
far as to seek the aid of non-gwahrai warriors for practice. (I'm not
sure
if he takes this training a bit further by joining one of Nnet Olotor's
armies as well, but I'll wait for other elements of the story to
develop
further before making that decision.)</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; In the three
years
following the attack that nearly killed him, Oinkillune developed a
strong
hatred towards bullies and people who use their power (political power,
size, etc.) to forcefully bend others to their will. He never backs
down
to a bully, nor does he allow anyone to talk down to him, but his
hatred
often clouds his judgment so that he forgets when he's overmatched.
Other
than this desire to preserve his pride, he does not suffer any other
lapses
in his judgement when it comes to violent confrontations, and respects
his physical limitations. Even though his contempt for violence has not
wavered, he won't hesitate to use it if need be. However, Oinkillune
still
doubts that he could ever use lethal force if he had to, and never
carries
his thornstick with the thorn attached.</font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Like most
Nnet
Olotorians, Oinkillune keeps track of the war between the Stevens
Empire
and Nnet Olotor, but he never bothered to learn too much about Earthen
culture and traditions. From the time he first heard about the war, he
had assumed that the evil ways of the Stevens Empire was the norm for
the
entire human race, and this prejudice was reinforced by the attack on
him
and Binky by the human thugs. As a result, Oinkillune has a great fear
and distrust towards the human race, not just the Stevens Empire, and
only
the few good humans he has met on occasion prevents him from thinking
that
the entire race is inherently and totally evil. During his travels,
Oinkillune
avoids human cities whenever he can, since he assumes that such places
are hotbeds of violent crime. Since his contact with humans is very
limited,
he has never bothered to learn their languages. Still, when Oinkillune
deals with unfamiliar but seemingly friendly Elven speaking humans, he
tries to put his prejudices aside and let his true, curtious nature
shine
through.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff0000">&gt; During the
past
few weeks, Oinkillune started having strange nightmares, in which the
evil
deity Zod pleaded with him to 'free' him, and promising the young elf
great
power if he did. The nightmares were getting progressively worse, and
Oinkillune
thought he might be going insane, so he told his family about the
dreams.
They insisted that he visit the Orb of Knowledge in order to get some
answers.</font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
