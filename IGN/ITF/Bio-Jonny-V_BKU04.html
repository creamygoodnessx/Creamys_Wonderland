<p>> Genevieve Alexandria Stevens is the daughter of Earthen conqueror
Emperor Stevens. She once had the potential of being a nice and sociable
person, but an unkind childhood changed all that. Genevieve grew up in
the Stevens Empire, a society dominated by idealism, in which its members
are judged primarily by their social class, gender, and physical appearance.
When Genevieve reached her adolecence, she did not fit the empire's ideals
as a good looking young lady, and was given a very hard time for it from
most of the people she knew, including her father. The empire is also heavily
male-oriented, in which men get to make all the important decisions and
hold positions of power, while women are meant to be seen and not heard,
and are given far fewer rights than male counterparts. Genevieve refused
to accept herself an an inferior, and always questioned the empire's gender
biased views. She repeatedly did things that were only acceptable for men
to do, such as carrying a weapon, and wearing certain attire, which caused
further resentment of her. Because the Stevens Empire looked down on the
practice of magic as witchcraft, Genevieve's open fascination with magic
only made her even more of an outcast. Noone in Genevieve's childhood showed
any compassion towards her, nor did they ever take anything she said or
did seriously. Whenever she tried to speak her mind in a serious manner,
it was always passed off as a joke. Genevieve spent her early years toeing
the line for her father and peers, and did everything she could to please
them, but all she ever got in return was disdain and ungratefulness. Whenever
Genevieve tried to resolve a personal dispute with her father in a diplomatic
and peaceful way, her efforts would always be thrown back in her face with
hostility, and her father would remind her of how worthless she was. Every
time such an incident occurred, it would stick into her memory for life,
and permanently erode her self esteem.
<p>> Genevieve's only salvation came in the form of an elven slave who,
like Genevieve, was an outcast to society, simply because of his race and
social status. This slave idea is still reletively new, so I haven't yet
come up with a name for him yet. Because the two were outcasts, it wasn't
difficult for them to form a strong emotional bond. When Genevieve was
twelve, she had once stood up for the slave, and protected him from a beating
from his cruel owners, so in return, the slave secretly spent his free
time teaching her how to speak, read, and write his language as a sign
of gratitude. Although the slave could speak English, he had a strong accent
from his native language, which was Nnet Olotor's most common elven language.
As a result, the slave kept mispronouncing Genevieve's name as "Johnny
V". Genevieve took advantage of her new language abilities by reading elven
literature and history. She also looked up everything she could about Nnet
Olotor's various magic orders, and what she could do to someday become
a mage herself. However, the Stevens Empire forbids the use of magic by
law, and the penalty for violating this law is death. So, at the age of
16, Genevieve finally defected from the empire, to persue her lifelong
dream of becoming a mage. I'm not yet sure what happened to the slave.
It's possible that Emporer Stevens brutally murdered him, because he discovered
the truth and felt that the slave was corrupting his daughter, and that
that was the final straw that pushed Genevieve to leave home. Or perhaps
Genevieve saw a once in a lifetime opportunity to help the slave to escape
the empire, and decided it was a good idea for her to leave as well. This
part of the story is still very much up in the air.
<p>---
<br>- (R) When Jonny-V defected from the Stevens Empire at the age of 16,
she immediately pursued her lifelong dream to become a mage. Because of
her hard work and fascination for the art of magic, it wasn't long before
she was granted a bit of magic energy of her own. (I'm not yet sure what
magic order Jonny-V joins, but it will most likely be controlled by a neutral
deity, and contains an variety of very destructive spells.)
<br>- (P) Decent fighter and a relatively powerful mage for someone who
has been in the practice for less that four years. Knows a good number
of spells.
<br>- (P) Takes her combat skills very seriously. Practices vigorously
every day. The only thing that Jonny-V ever trusts is her combat training.
<br>- (R) Not long after Jonny-V learned her first spell, she joined the
good armies of Nnet Olotor not only because she wanted save the world she
had recently come to greatly appreciate, but also to get revenge against
her father for all of the pain he inflicted on her by robbing him of his
dream to conquer Nnet Olotor.
<br>- (R) Because Jonny-V often eavesdropped on her father's secret meetings
before her defection, she has inside knowledge of the plans for both the
Stevens Empire, and the Zodians. Because of this knowledge, Jonny-V was
able to become a chief advisor of one of the good Nnet Olotorian armies.
<br>- (HR) Started calling herself "Jonny-V" after someone mispronounced
her name.
<br>---
<br>- (PH) After her defection, Genevieve was finally being respected as
a person by citizens of Nnet Olotor, but the emotional damage from her
past had already taken its toll on her personality.
<br>- (P) Doesn't trust anybody. This is a result of her trust being violated
one too many times during her early adolescence in the Empire.
<br>- (P) Hostile towards everybody. Refuses to be nice to anyone in fear
of someone trampling on her goodwill, like those during her adolescence
would.
<br>- (P) Almost never smiles and shows little emotion.
<br>- (P) Very violent and explosive personality.
<br>- (P) Would not go out of her way to help a stranger.
<br>- (P) Does not tolerate underachievers.
<br>- (PR) Although Jonny-V possesses many of her father's negative personality
traits and is considered by many to be evil, she does have a latent conscience,
which shows itself from time to time.
<br>- (PR) Unlike her father, Jonny-V is not a coward.
<br>- (P) Secretly wants to gain back her innocence, and wants to return
to her nice self.
<br>- (PR) Ashamed to talk about her abusive past.
<br>---
<br>- (R) Visited Oinkillune at the beginning of the story and brings him
into the story, but refused to reveal any vital information to him. She
demanded that Oinkillune come with her, no questions asked.
<br>- (R) Initially more powerful than Oinkillune, but knows that with
the proper training, Oinkillune would have a fighting potential that would
surpass Jonny-V's several thousand times over.
<br>- (P) Envies Oinkillune for growing up in a loving environment, and
ponders if the world would survive his potential wrath if he had grown
up the way she had.
<br>- (PR) As the story develops, certain events cause Jonny-V's negative
traits to slowly recede, thanks in no small part to Oinkillune.
<br>---
<br>- SPOILERS -
<br>- (S!) (R) Within the walls of Zod's fortress, lies a collection of
enchanted gems, which were created after the Zodian angels were conceived.
The gems allow anyone who uses them to see through the eyes and hear though
the ears of the Zodian angels, and each gem is associated to a particular
angel. Since her defection, Jonny-V has been watching Oinkillune through
the use of his gem.
