<p><font color="#FF8080">> Binky is a preteen gwahrai who lives in a treetop
village in the middle of a forest close to Nnet Olotor's equator. She is
a high-spirited bundle of energy who does not seem to have an "off switch".
She is exceptionally curious, even by gwahrai standards, and has a natural
flair for adventure. This curiosity often gets her into trouble, because
she often sneaks away from the safety of the village to explore the wilderness
alone, sometimes getting herself into life-threatening situations. In such
cases, her adopted brother Oinkillune has to find her, rescue her if necessary,
and then escort her home.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> But sneaking out of town isn't the only kind
of trouble Binky gets herself into. She is extremely reckless and does
not understand the difference between acts of courage and foolish risks.
She regularly tries to 'prove' her supposed bravery by performing dangerous
stunts. Sometimes, Binky and her friends like to anger dangerous wild animals,
and provoke the animals into attacking them. (This could be a gwahrai equivalent
of 'cow-tipping'.) Binky also loves to perform stunts in public, including
demonstrating her 'escape artist' skills. There may be instances where
Binky's stunts went horribly wrong, and would have resulted in her death
if Oinkillune hadn't jumped in and saved her. But no matter how many times
Binky barely escapes death from her foolish stunts, she doesn't appear
to learn from her ways, and keeps getting into trouble over and over again.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> Until recently, Binky was a compulsive thief,
and has shoplifted from stores and stands in various towns and cities.
She also developed a knack for picking pockets in crowded environments,
sometimes being able to steal enchanted items from powerful warriors. However,
when Binky was last caught stealing over a year ago, her family decided
that they'd had enough of the shame she brought upon them, and forbade
her from traveling outside the village until she learned her lesson. Since
then, Binky has apparently put an end to her dishonest ways, and has given
up shoplifting and pick-pocketing altogether.</font>
