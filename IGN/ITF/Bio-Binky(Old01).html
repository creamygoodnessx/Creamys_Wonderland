<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Binky is Oinkillune's nine
year-old little
sister. Although her name is Taelin, she prefers to call herself
'Binky'
for short. (Remember, names are subject to change.) She is far too
brave
for her own good, frequently getting into all kinds of trouble with the
authorities, mainly for stealing, trespassing, and picking other
people's&nbsp;
locks. Binky has a natural flair for adventure, and often sneaks out of
town to go exploring in the wilderness, frequently getting into
life-threatening
situations. In such cases, her adopted brother Oinkillune has to find
her,
rescue her if necessary, and then escort her home. Oinkillune has
always
been Binky's sworn protector, but during their adventures together
since
they left home for the Orb, Binky is convinced that it's the other way
around.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Because Binky's parents are
locksmiths,
Binky had the chance to become an extraordinary thief at an early age.
Whenever she was caught stealing, or doing some other mischievous
action,
her parents punished her by locking her in the supply room, which held
locks of various types, keys, and a few other items. At first, Binky
would
pass the time by seeing which keys fit which locks. When that lost it's
fun, Binky began fiddling with the locks by jamming a variety of
objects
into them. When Binky was sent to the supply room the first few times,
her lock picking attempts resulted in disappointment. Eventually, she
began
meeting with success. Her lock picking skills improved steadily, so
that
by the time she was eight, she had the lock picking skills of an
experienced
thief, and could pick a variety of locks with relative ease. Binky also
developed a skill in escaping from several types of traps and binds.
She
would occasionally perform feats of escape in the village's equivalent
of a town square. One day, when Binky was performing a particularly
dangerous
stunt, something went wrong and Binky was nearly killed. At least, she
would have been if Oinkillune hadn't intervened. (I still haven't
decided
on the exact stunt she attempted.) As shaken up as Binky was about the
near-tragedy, her dreams of becoming a world-famous escape artist
remained
rock-solid.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
