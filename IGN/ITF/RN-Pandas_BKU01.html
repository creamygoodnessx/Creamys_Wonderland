<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 43) - Spontaneous generation means
that a life form originates from non-living matter. However, this does
not necessarily mean that a lifeform appears instantaneously, it only means
that it appears unaided by any previous life, regardless of the amount
of time the lifeform takes to appear.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 43) - In the early 1920's, Russian
biochemist A. I. Oparin first came up with the theory about the origins
of life that is widely accepted today. He suggested that the first living
cells formed gradually as the result of certain chemical reactions over
a very long period of time. In 1928, a similar theory about the origins
of life was proposed by English biochemist J. B. S. Haldane. His theory
was that the first living cells were created when the mixture of water
vapor, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen were exposed to the ultra-violet
light from the sun. Although their theory, the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis,
is still widely followed today, many modifications have been made to it
since its creation.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 48) - According to the original Oparin-Haldane
hypothesis, there was little or no oxygen in the atmosphere in prebiotic
times (before the existence of life) around 3 billion years ago. Since
oxygen destroys living compounds in a process called oxidation, an oxygen-free
environment should have made it possible for organic compounds to mix and
create the first living cells. However, many scientists now believe that
there may have been significant amounts of oxygen back then, creating a
problem for the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 43) - According to the original Oparin-Haldane
hypothesis, the first living cells were created high up in the atmosphere
when the mixture of water vapor, ammonia, methane, and hydrogen were exposed
to certain energy sources, such as ultra-violet light, and electrical storms.
This led to the formation of the first organic materials on Earth. When
these organic compounds gathered in the ocean after their formation, they
mixed and reacted with each other to form more complicated substances,
such as proteins, DNA, and sugar molecules. As the process continued, more
and more complex chemicals were formed, and this process eventually led
to the first living cells.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 49) - The energy that builds up complex
chemicals, such as amino acids, from simpler ones is also the energy that
breaks them down again. If the complex chemicals are to be preserved, they
would have to reach and be dissolved by the ocean waters. However, since
these chemicals are formed way up in the atmosphere most of them would
be destroyed before they could reach the ocean.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 44) - The first living cells were anaerobic,
which means they could survive without oxygen. They were also heterotrophic,
meaning they were unable to produce their own food from inorganic materials.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 52) - When certain amino acids join
together in a nitrogen atmosphere at certain temperatures, they can form
long chains of amino acids called "proteinoids". These proteinoids are
not true proteins, but contain some of their properties. If proteinoids
are dissolved in boiling water which is then cooled, they will clump together
in a spherical form. It's believed by some scientists that these "proteinoid
microspheres" can eventually develop into cells.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 53) - Cells are highly complex biological
machines, and are far more complex than proteinoid microspheres. A single
DNA molecule of any given cell contains about 60 different types of proteins,
and if even one of these proteins is missing, the cell will not create
new proteins. A cell is so complex, that it probably could not be created
by the chance mixing of random proteins, even given billions of years.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 55) -&nbsp;&nbsp; - Because of the high
level of improbability that cells could be generated by the random mixing
of chemicals, some scientists believe that the first cells were created
from the design of some outside, intelligent force.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">--- CHAPTER 2 ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 59) - Charles Darwin initially believed
that all of the traits within a given creature were the blended result
from both of its parents. If a creature had a particular trait, it would
be lost in future generations because of the blending. This theory was
eventually proven false.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 60) - The studies of Gregor Mendel proved
that the traits of a given creature are preserved as they pass from generation
to generation. This is because the traits of two parents, rather than mixing
in their offspring, are kept separate. The offspring exhibits only one
of these traits (the dominant trait), while the other remains hidden (the
recessive trait). Both of these traits is then passed onto further generations.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 64) - During the late 19th Century,
it was believed that common traits in a gene pool were caused by common
genes and became increasingly common, and less common traits were caused
by less common genes and were becoming less common. However, it was later
discovered that common traits were caused by dominant genes, and less common
traits were the result of recessive genes. Such genes were as common as
they were in one generation as they were in past generations.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 65) - Genetic mutations can reduce the
number of a particular gene in a gene pool, and can result in new genes.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 66) -&nbsp;&nbsp; - Most genetic mutations
are detrimental to a given species, and include genetic diseases. Only
1 in 1000 of such mutations can benefit the species.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 75) - The more surface area a creature
has, the faster it will lose heat. The more body mass (volume) a creature
has, the faster it will gain heat.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">-----------&nbsp;&nbsp; - Slim creatures with
long, slender limbs have a higher surface to volume ratio and will cool
off faster. Fatter creatures with short limbs have a lower surface to volume
ratio and will cool off more slowly. This is why creatures in the arctic
tend to have fat bodies and short limbs, while creatures that live in hot
climates are thin and have long, thin limbs.</font>
<p><font color="#33FF33">- The Nnet Olotorian animal kingdom will most
likely follow this same pattern. This info will help me greatly in designing
and developing my animal kingdom.</font>
<br><font color="#33FF33">-&nbsp;&nbsp; - The gwahrai have long and slender
bodies, and they live in a tropical environment. It's a good thing I designed
them this way, because otherwise I'd have to overhaul their entire body
structure.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">--- CHAPTER 3 ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 78) - It's possible for a phylum to
contain only one species. If this is the case, the phylum is considered
the same as the species.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 79) - Genetic change in a species is
more likely to take place in small populations than in larger ones.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 80) - Members of small populations are
usually forced to interbreed very closely. When a genetic mutation occurs
in such a population, it's more likely to spread throughout the entire
population than in a larger population. Genetic mutations are likely to
accumilate in the species in a small population, rather than spreading
itself thin and disappearing like they would do in larger populations.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">(From Page 82) - If a species is spread out over
a very large geographical area, many variations of the species can exist.
Members in one area will probably be only slightly different from its surrounding
neighbors, because a local population is more likey to interbreed with
its immediate neighbors than with any other populations. This interbreeding
keeps neighboring populations from genetically drifting too far from each
other. However, because populations that live on opposite edges of the
geographical area don't normally get a chance to exchange genetic material,
random genetic mutations can cause them to drift apart over time. Eventually,
the two populations can become genetically incompatable. However, they
will still be considered to be part of the same species, because of their
ability to mate with their intermediates. However, if those intermediates
should somehow disappear, the two surviving, incompatable populations can
then be classified as two seperate species.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">- (p. 84) - Reproductive isolation can also happen
when a single environment contains varying geological conditions, such
as different food sources, elevation, and temperature. A single species
living in such a diverse environment can inhabit several different parts
of it. Each of the species' populations will adapt to whatever conditions
they live in, because natural selection will promote characteristics that
will help them to survive under such conditions. The populations in each
of the geological niches can become genetically isolated from each other
if the genetic changes significantly differ from population to population.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
