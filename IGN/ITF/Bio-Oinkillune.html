<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
is a
young teenage elf who was abandoned by his mother as an infant. He was
adopted by a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Race-Gwahrai_Page%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">gwahrai</a>
couple from his infancy, and lives with them in their home in a village
in the woods. He is someone with a high degree of ethical standards,
and
puts the needs of others ahead of his own, often going out of his way
to
help total strangers in need without expecting anything in return.
Despite
being drastically physically different from his gwahrai peers, he has
no
trouble fitting into their society, and has become an excellent tree
climber
despite not having a tail or hands for feet. He values the well being
of
his family and community over all things. </font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">Oinkillune </font></font><font
 face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">has a
gentleman-like and magnetic personality, tends to get along with
everyone
he meets, and never looks down upon people.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Oinkillune
considers
his biggest challenge to be looking after his 13 year old
(approximately
nine in human years) sister
<a href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Binky%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Binky</a>.
Binky is exceptionally curious, even by gwahrai standards, and does not
know the difference between an act of bravery and a foolish risk. She
is
extremely reckless and must be watched at all times in order to be kept
out of harm's way. Binky's reckless actions have included things like
challenging
predatory beasts to one-on-one fights, and attempting dangerous stunts,
but her brother has always been fortunate enough to consistently save
Binky
from her own suicidal nature.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Binky is not
Oinkillune's
only concern in life. Although the gwahrai who raised Oinkillune are a
peaceful community, they are no strangers to violence. They constantly
live under the threat of not only attacks from the predatory beasts
that
regularly try to feed on them, but also from the occasional invasion
from
rogue states. Like most of the members of his adopted race, Oinkillune
carries a gwahrai thornstick and sling with him at all times, and is
always
ready to join his community in defending the village should such an
emergency
arise. However, despite bearing the responsibility of defending his
community,
Oinkillune always doubted if he could ever bring himself to use his
weapons
for lethal force if he needed to. He is someone who shuns violence,
preferring
to reason with his enemies, and only uses violence when absolutely
necessary.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Since
Oinkillune's
birth, he's never left the forest he has always called home. As the
result,
he's never gotten know much about any of Nnet Olotor's races other the
gwahrai who raised him, and their elven neighbors who's homes are
scattered
throughout the forest floor. However, something happened to his
community
that would have a lasting impact on the way he felt about the human
race.
A few years ago, the Stevens Empire began expanding their army. Because
the interdimensional portal had recently been shut down by Nnet
Olotor's
good armies, the empire needed vast quantities of building materials to
maintain and expand their army. One of these materials was wood, and in
order to obtain the amount they needed, the empire began to clear cut
the
forest the gwahrai depended on for survival. When the gwahrai realized
the empire's clear cutting campaign was headed towards their villages,
they attacked the empire, driving them away from the forest. However,
the
Stevens Empire soon returned with a vengeance. Several hundred imperial
troops stormed the forest, killing everything in sight, and laying
torch
to the trees in an effort to burn the gwahrai from their hiding places.
With the help of their elven allies, and perhaps even a bit of divine
intervention,
the gwahrai were able to defeat the invaders, but the price of victory
was high. Nearly half of the gwahrai homes were destroyed, and several
hundred gwahrai and elves perished, including some of Oinkillune's
closest
friends. As a result of the attack, Oinkillune developed a deep hatred
towards the human race. Because he had never seen or heard of any
humans
other than the ones who attacked his village, it was easy for him to
assume
that all humans were inherently heartless and bloodthirsty savages.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; When Oinkillune was 12 years old,
he
discovered a strange energy coursing through his body. At first,
neither
he nor his gwahrai family knew what the energy was all about; some
thought
there was something wrong with Oinkillune, while others thought it was
some kind of a divine sign. However, when one of the elves, who lived
on
the forest floor and frequently traveled outside the forest, heard of
Oinkillune's
energy, he told the young elf that he was a Zodian <font
 color="#ff8080"><a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Angel">angel</a></font>,
and that the energy within him was <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a>. He then went on to tell Oinkillune everything he knew about
Zod and the Zodian angels, and that Oinkillune should never let anyone
know that he was such an angel. If the wrong people were to know what
he
was, they would hunt him down and kill him. If ever asked about his
magic
energy, the traveling elf suggested that Oinkillune pass himself off as
a standard <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a>.
Oinkillune was devastated to learn that he was spawned by a being of
such
evil for the purpose of evil, and vowed never to use his magic energy
in
fear of supporting the deity. However, after the attack on his home by
the Stevens Empire, Oinkillune began to use his magic energy to enhance
the fighting abilities he'd already learned from his family. This made
him a far more powerful fighter than before, but although he began
integrating
magic techniques into his fighting skills, he still refused to learn
any
of the actual spells in the <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a> he was bound to. Oinkillune is naturally an elf, and was
taught
to fight with gwahrai techniques, and this added to his magic energy
gives
him a fighting potential that far surpasses that of a normal gwahrai or
elf, even without the knowledge of Zodian spells. He is so fast and
agile,
that he can single handedly take down a pair of predatory beasts, or a
small group of highly trained and well armed Stevens imperial soldiers
without taking a single hit.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Fortunately for Oinkillune, his
family
did not treat him as a pariah upon learning about the evil energy that
flowed within him. They instead decided to judge him by his good
nature,
and most of them were glad that he had the energy to assist him in
fighting
off predators, and even more so rouge states, mainly the Stevens
Empire.
In fact in the years to come, the empire attacked the gwahrai villages
again to clear the way for chopping down their forest for wood. But
when
the empire learned of the elf who they considered to be a god-like
warrior,
most of their troops refused to return to the forest in fear of facing
him. As a result, the empire eventually stopped attacking the forest in
favor of easier targets. But despite the tremendous power that Zod's
magic
energy gives him, <font color="#ff8080">he sees this energy as a curse
and a disease, and has always had nightmares about it consuming his
soul,
and turning him into a monster that would commit unimaginable acts of
evil.
Oinkillune hopes to someday find a way to purge Zod's magic energy from
his body, and to earn the magic energy of a deity whose ideals more
closely
match his own.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Oinkillune enters the story when
he meets
<a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Jonny-V%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Jonny-V</a>
in the forest. (I'm not yet sure why Jonny-V chose to enter the Gwahrai
Forest. Maybe she picked a fight with the wrong people and had to flee
after she realized she was hopelessly outmatched, and that her escape
route
just happened to lead to Oinkillune's village. Maybe Jonny-V heard the
rumors about an ultra-powerful fighter who protected the woods from
outsiders,
and went there specifically to challenge Oinkillune to a fight. Or
maybe
she was passing through. At this point, I just haven't figured it out
yet.)
She accidentally or reluctantly saves Oinkillune's or Binky's life,
forcing
Oinkillune to honor a gwahrai custom in which if someone saves the life
of a gwahrai, that gwahrai must accompany his/her savior until the
favor
is likewise returned. The thought of fulfilling this tradition makes
Oinkillune
cringe, because not only will he be venturing outside of the forest for
the first in his life, but he will have to be in the constant presence
of a human who perfectly fits the bloodthirsty and ruthless stereotype
he's pinned on the entire human race. Binky also comes along for the
adventure,
although I haven't yet figured out exactly why. (She could have snuck
out
of the forest to accompany her brother, and to get a sense of what a
real
adventure is like. Or it could be because it was Binky's life who
Jonny-V
saved, making her the one bound to her people's custom, and Oinkillune
decided to tag along to protect his sister.)</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; When Oinkillune and Binky first
begin
adventuring with Jonny-V, the human mage sees her two new followers as
useless baggage and threatens to physically harm them unless they stay
out of her way. She is rude and hostile towards them, but Oinkillune
soon
discovers that Jonny-V was once potentially a good and caring person
until
her father's abuse changed all that. Despite Jonny-V's rudeness and
violent
nature, and the way Oinkillune feels about the human race, he
instinctively
tries to see whatever good is left in her. He feels that Jonny-V wants
to go back to her good self, and helps her do so, even though Jonny-V
had
long given up on that goal. But in helping Jonny-V return to her good
self,
Oinkillune learns that not all humans are monsters, and not to judge
people
simply because of their race. When Jonny-V learns that Oinkillune is a
Zodian angel, and that he refuses to learn the spells in his magic
order,
she becomes enraged and accuses the young elf of making himself
selectively
weak for the sake of worthless ethics. Even so, she recognizes
Oinkillune
as a powerful ally, and eventually respects him for his combat skills.
With him at her side, Jonny-V would now have a far greater chance of
achieving
her ultimate goal of overthrowing her father's empire.</font>
