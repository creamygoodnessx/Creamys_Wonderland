<p>> Genevieve Alexandria Stevens is the daughter of Earthen conqueror
Emperor Stevens. She once had the potential of being a nice and sociable
person, but an unkind childhood changed all that. Genevieve grew up in
the Stevens Empire, a society dominated by idealism, in which its members
are judged primarily by their social class, gender, and physical appearance.
When Genevieve reached her adolecence, she did not fit the empire's ideals
as a good looking young lady, and was given a very hard time for it from
most of the people she knew, mainly her father and his elitist peers. (The
ideal look for a woman in the Steven's Empire is to have a tall and slender
body, and a youthful appearance, but Genevieve was a very heavy set girl
in her adolecence.)&nbsp; The empire is also heavily male-oriented, in
which men get to make all the important decisions and hold positions of
power, while women are meant to be seen and not heard, and are given far
fewer rights than male counterparts. Genevieve refused to accept herself
an an inferior, and always questioned the empire's gender biased views.
She repeatedly did things that were only acceptable for men to do, such
as carrying a weapon, and wearing certain male attire, which earned her
further resentment. Because the Stevens Empire looked down on the practice
of magic as witchcraft, Genevieve's open fascination with magic only made
her even more of an outcast. Noone in Genevieve's childhood showed any
compassion towards her, nor did they ever take anything she said or did
seriously. Whenever she tried to speak her mind in a serious manner, it
was always passed off as a joke. Her father didn't even care that she stood
in the war room and listened in on his private military meetings with his
generals, top military advisors, and his Zodian allies, and he never thought
that Genevieve might someday turn on him. Genevieve spent her early years
toeing the line for her father and peers, and did everything she could
to please them, but all she ever got in return was disdain and ungratefulness.
Whenever Genevieve tried to resolve a personal dispute with her father
in a diplomatic and peaceful way, her efforts would always be thrown back
in her face with hostility, and her father would remind her of how worthless
she was. Every time such an incident occurred, it would stick into her
memory for life, and permanently erode her ever diminishing good nature.
<p>> Genevieve's only salvation came in the form of an elven slave who,
like Genevieve, was an outcast to society, simply because of his race and
social status. This slave idea is still reletively new, so I haven't yet
come up with a name for him yet. Because the two were outcasts, it wasn't
difficult for them to form a strong emotional bond. When Genevieve was
twelve, she had once stood up for the slave, and protected him from a beating
from his cruel owners. In return, the slave secretly spent his free time
teaching her how to speak, read, and write his language as a sign of gratitude.
Although the slave could speak English, he had a strong accent from his
native language, which was Nnet Olotor's most common elven language. As
a result, the slave kept mispronouncing Genevieve's name as "Johnny V".
Genevieve took advantage of her new language abilities by reading elven
literature and history. She also looked up everything she could about Nnet
Olotor's various magic orders, and what she could do to someday become
a mage herself. However, the Stevens Empire forbids the use of magic by
law, and the penalty for violating this law is death. So, at the age of
16, Genevieve finally mustered up the courage to defect from the empire,
to persue her lifelong dream of becoming a mage. I'm not yet sure what
happened to the slave. It's possible that Emporer Stevens brutally murdered
him, because he discovered the truth and felt that the slave was corrupting
his daughter, and that that was the final straw that pushed Genevieve to
leave home. Or perhaps Genevieve saw a once in a lifetime opportunity to
help him to escape the empire, and decided it was a good idea for her to
leave as well. This part is still very much up in the air.
<p>> When Genevieve Stevens defected from the Stevens Empire, she officially
adopted the name "Jonny-V", since it was the name refered to her by the
only person who ever appreciated her. Because she was no longer under the
Stevens Empire's restrictive heel, Jonny-V could pursue her lifelong dream
to become a mage, and wasted no time in doing so. Because of her hard work
and fascination for the art of magic, it wasn't long before she was granted
a bit of magic energy of her own. (I'm not yet sure what magic order Jonny-V
joins, but it will most likely be controlled by a neutral deity, and contains
an variety of very destructive spells.) She is a decent fighter and a relatively
powerful mage for someone who has been in the practice for less that four
years. She knows a good number of spells in her magic order, as well as
a few magic techniques, some of which she developed herself. Jonny-V takes
her combat and magic skills very seriously, and practices them vigorously
every day. The only thing that Jonny-V ever trusts in life is her combat
and magic training, and is always seeking ways to test the limits of her
combat prowess. Not long after Jonny-V learned her first spell, she became
a chief advisor for one of the good armies of Nnet Olotor. Obtaining such
a position wasn't very hard for her, because she often listened in on her
father's secret meetings before her defection. As a result, she has inside
knowledge of the plans for both the Stevens Empire and the Zodians. Jonny-V
hopes her position will help her to get revenge against her father for
all of the pain he inflicted on her by robbing him of his dream to conquer
Nnet Olotor.
<p>> After her defection, Jonny-V was finally starting to be respected
as a person. The kindness showed to her by the citizens of Nnet Olotor
was a welcome change from the abuse from her adolecence, but the emotional
damage of her past had already taken its toll on her goodwill. As Jonny-V's
past abuse by her father and his acquaintances diminished her innocence,
she built an emotional wall around herself&nbsp; in order to cope with
it. At the time, she was afraid to talk back to them, because she knew
what they were capable of, so she was forced to keep her emotions bottled
up. Jonny-V is constantly haunted by the fact she didn't retaliate against
them when she had a chance, but does so vicariously through other people
with her violent and explosive personality. Jonny-V is hostile towards
everybody, and refuses to be nice to anyone in fear of someone taking advantage
of her goodwill, like those during her adolescence did. Because her trust
was repeatedly trampled on during her days in the Empire, she has vowed
to never trust anyone again. She secretly wants to return to her nice and
trusting self, but doesn't know if she'll ever be able to work up the courage
to do so. Besides, she figures that she's already made too bad of a reputaion
for herself for anyone to be friends with her anyway.

Empire at the age of 16, she immediately pursued her lifelong dream to

<br><font color="#FFFF00">- (R) Not long after Jonny-V learned her first

because she wanted save the world she had recently come to greatly appreciate,
but also to get revenge against her father for all of the pain he inflicted
on her by robbing him of his dream to conquer Nnet Olotor.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">- (R) Because Jonny-V often eavesdropped on her
father's secret meetings before her defection, she has inside knowledge
of the plans for both the Stevens Empire, and the Zodians. Because of this
knowledge, Jonny-V was able to become a chief advisor of one of the good
Nnet Olotorian armies.</font>

someone mispronounced her name.</font>

<br>* Hope for Jonny-V.
<br>- (PR) Although Jonny-V possesses many of her father's negative personality
traits and is considered by many to be evil, she does have a latent conscience,
which shows itself from time to time.
<br>- (PR) Unlike her father, Jonny-V is not a coward.
<br><font color="#FF0000">- (PR) Ashamed to talk about her abusive past.</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">- (P) She has so far been unable to adjust to
life in a friendly environment.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">- (P) Secretly wants to gain back her innocence,
and wants to return to her nice self, but is afraid to undo the wall she
built around herself.</font>
<br>- Jonny-V's hope in&nbsp; ... lies in the fact that she does not want
to like her father, and the fact that her past abuse has not completely
destroyed her potential nice self.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>---
<br>- (R) Visited Oinkillune at the beginning of the story and brings him
into the story, but refused to reveal any vital information to him. She
demanded that Oinkillune come with her, no questions asked.
<br>- (R) Initially more powerful than Oinkillune, but knows that with
the proper training, Oinkillune would have a fighting potential that would
surpass Jonny-V's several thousand times over.
<br>- (P) Envies Oinkillune for growing up in a loving environment, and
ponders if the world would survive his potential wrath if he had grown
up the way she had.
<br>- (PR) As the story develops, certain events cause Jonny-V's negative
traits to slowly recede, thanks in no small part to Oinkillune.
<br>---
<br>- SPOILERS -
<br>- (S!) (R) Within the walls of Zod's fortress, lies a collection of
enchanted gems, which were created after the Zodian angels were conceived.
The gems allow anyone who uses them to see through the eyes and hear though
the ears of the Zodian angels, and each gem is associated to a particular
angel. Since her defection, Jonny-V has been watching Oinkillune through
the use of his gem.
