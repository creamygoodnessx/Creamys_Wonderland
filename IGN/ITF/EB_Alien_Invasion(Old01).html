<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; The story of Evil Blood is set in
a dimension
that is parallel to Earth, during Earth's Crusades or some similar time
period. This alternate dimension is currently called Nnet Olotor,
although
the name of this universe is very likely to change. Unlike Earth, Nnet
Olotor has a strange energy field that enables intelligent beings to
cast
magic. It is a world that is inhabited by several races of people, but
until 20 years ago, bore no humans. These first humans were pulled from
Earth in some kind of freak accident, either a teleportation spell gone
awry, or by a natural interdimensional phenomenon. Either way, the new
humans convinced the Nnet Olotorians to open a permanent gateway, so
that
the people of both worlds could trade freely. This gesture of courtesy
of the Nnet Olotorians was to be their potential downfall, and would
change
their way of life forever. Not long after the permanent gateway was
opened,
the humans began to show their true nature. They began pillaging Nnet
Olotorian
civilizations, converting the Nnet Olotorians to their religions,
enslaving
them, and committing genocide. The Nnet Olotorians knew the Earthlings
were not going to stop until they've taken everything the Nnet
Olotorians
had worked so hard to gain. In desperation, they closed the gate
connecting
the two worlds, stopping the flood of reinforcements from the Earth,
but
by then it was too late. The humans had already mastered the art of
magic,
and were over 30,000 strong on Nnet Olotor. However, they did not know
how to open another gate back to Earth, and this brought the war to a
stalemate.
They did however, come to understand that only a select few Nnet
Olotorian
wizards knew how to open another interdimensional portal, and shared
the
secret with an intelligent magical item they called the Orb of
Knowledge.
The humans knew that without reinforcements from Earth, they would be
vulnerable
to any Nnet Olotorian counter-attack. The humans' only hope to conquer
Nnet Olotor was to extract the information they needed on opening a new
gate to Earth from the Orb. However, even though the Orb was openly
accessible
to the public and shared its secrets with anyone who touched it, it
would
always deny certain knowledge to anyone with evil intentions, and to
anyone
who tried to extract sensitive information on behalf of such people.
But
that wouldn't stop the humans from trying, and the Nnet Olotorians knew
that unless the humans were brought under control soon, they would be
successful
in opening another portal to Earth, and all would be lost for Nnet
Olotor.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
