<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrai are a small, tree-dwelling race
found almost exclusively in one particular large tropical forest somewhere
near Nnet Olotor's equator. They are named by the elves after their battle
cry / distress call, which sounds like a high-pitched "gwaaahhhh!". They
are naturally equipped for the forest they call home. The avarage adult
gwahrai stands about 90 centimeters tall, and weighs around 20 pounds.
They have small and slender lemur-like bodies, small heads, long bushy
tails, an extra pair of hands in place of feet. They usually stand on all-fours,
but can stand on their hind legs for short periods of time. On the ground,
the gwahrai get around by bounding and crawling. Because of their lightweight
frame and powerful legs, they are able to leap great distances from a standing
start, and often use this ability to travel from tree to tree with great
ease. Each of the gwahrai's four hands have three very long fingers plus
an opposable thumb, so that their hands resemble an Earthen bird's claw,
minus the sharp points. The tip of each finger is a sticky circular pad,
much like those on the feet of Earthen frogs, allowing the gwahrai to hang
onto the sides of trees. They can also hang on branches using their tails.
The gwahrai are primarily herbavoires, living on the wide variety of vegitation
their forest provides. They also feast on insects when they get a chance.
They have an extremely high metabolism, and consume up to half their weight
of food daily. Most of the food the gwahrai eat is very high in nutrition,
contributing both to their highly energetic nature, and high level of intelligence.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> Out of all the sentient beings on Nnet Olotor,
the gwahrai are by far the most dependant on their natural environment
for survival. While they benefit greatly from being so well adapted for
the forest they call home, they don't adapt well to any other environment.
The gwahrai are strictly tropical creatures, and would not survive long
under any cold conditions. The trees provide shelter from the predators
that constantly hunt them. But the one thing that ties the gwahrai to the
forest more than anything else is their limited diet. The gwahrai's forest
home has an array of vegetaion that provides the gwahrai with the optimal
balance of nutrients they need to stay healthy and active. While other
places on Nnet Olotor have vegetation that is tolerable for gwahrai consumption,
such vegetation may not fully fulfill their strict diet requirements. As
a result, gwahrai who travel to foreign towns and cities are usually not
as energetic as they would be in their native habitat.</font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- PERSONALITY ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrai can be described as a spartan race
of people. They focus their lives around raising their young, contributing
to their community, and surviving the next predator attack. The driving
force of their society is maintaining the prosperity of the community,
rather than the acquisition of wealth. Most gwahrai don't understand the
concept of materialism, and look down on people who spend so much of their
hard earned resources to obtain expensive luxuries. The gwahrai tend to
persue only what they need to survive, although they have been known to
keep useless items of sentimental value, such as a first tooth, or an item
won from a defeated powerful enemy. They prefer practicality over glamour,
and would rather wear a comfortable but plain outfit, rather than a beautiful
outfit that restricts movement.</font>
<p>> The gwahrai are <font color="#FF8080">exceptionally curious about
the world around them, and are often seen exploring the forest well outside
of their villiages. Sometimes, they're even seen traveling outside the
forest, usually in the company of members of other races. Unlike many other
races who naturally fear the unknown until it proves itself safe, the gwahrai
don't fear anything until they have a reason to fear it.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">* prefer comfort over glamour.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* exceptionally curious about the world around

<br><font color="#FF8080">* very chaotic in nature, and generally don't

<br><font color="#FFFF00">* very energetic</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* generally don't fear something until there's

<br><font color="#FF8080">* highly altruistic: evil gwahrai are few and

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- CIVILIZATION ---</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">* because members of both genders are physically
very similiar, females are seen as social equals to their male counterparts.</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">* The benefits and hazards to a gwahrai's lifespan
have helped the gwahrai to establish a population equilibrium with their
environment, so that they neither have to worry about overpopulation nor
endangerment of extinction.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* Can't understand why the other races are so
materialistic, and see materialism in general as a weakness.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* frequently seen in small groups venturing outside
the forest, often with the company of woodland elves.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">---</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* Have an extraordinary knowledge of the forest.
(What berries are good to eat, how to make crude weapons and tools, etc.)</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* Since enough food grows wild in the forest
to support the gwahrai population, they never needed to develop agriculture.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* because the forest provides the gwahrai everything
they need for survival, and it's warm all year long, the gwahrai are able
to establish permanent villiages, and don't have to migrate.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* Although a rare occurence, some gwahrai families
have been known to live in the civiliations of elves and humans. However,
due mainly to the gwahrai's physical dependance to the forest, they do
not expand and settle into new territories, but stick to the forest generation
after generation.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">---</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* overwhelmingly peaceful, but will not hesitate
to defend themselves when need be.</font>
<br><font color="#FF8080">* Greatly value individual freedom. The gwahrai
would rather be allowed to defend themselves than give up their freedoms
for extra security.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* Some gwahrai villiages are shared peacefully
with woodland elves in what can be called a "bunk-bed" coexsistance; the
elves living on the forest floor while the gwahrai reside high in the trees.
The two races intermingle in certain events, such as out-of-forest adventures,
hunting trips, survival training, and festivals.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">* The gwahrai were the primary influence of the
culture of the first generations of wood elves, and shaped how the elves
felt about things like gender equality, law, and warfare.</font><font color="#FF8080"></font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> Because the gwahrai are so well physically adapted
to their forest home, they don't need to change their environment to suit
themselves, like members of most other races do. Not surprisingly, the
gwahrai have an extraordinary knowledge of the forest, and know how to
use it to suit their needs. They know what berries are good to eat, how
to make crude weapons and tools, etc. Since more than enough food grows
wild in the forest to support the gwahrai population, they never needed
to develop agriculture. The gwahrai don't have to worry about overpopulation,
since they can only mate at certain times each year, and because they are
regularly the victims of predator attacks. Because the forest provides
the gwahrai everything they need for survival, and because it's in a tropical
zone, the gwahrai are able to establish permanent villiages, and don't
have to migrate in response to any climate changes. Although a rare occurence,
some gwahrai families have been known to live in the civiliations of elves
and humans. However, due mainly to the gwahrai's physical dependance to
the forest, they do not expand and settle into new territories, but stick
to the forest generation after generation.</font><font color="#FF8080"></font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- LANGUAGE ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> The gwahrais' evolutionary ancestors posessed
a very loud distress call which was similar to that of an Earthen sea gull.
The language they use today is based on that call, and is spoken through
the use of&nbsp; pitch and volume changes in the call, but also through
the limited use of sounds in human and elven lauages, as well as high and
low clicks. They are not physically capable of making all of the verbal
sounds of a human or elf, and are limited to the use of&nbsp; 'm', 'ow',
'g', 'oo', and 'ah'. To most outsiders, the gwahrai language may sound
like primitave howling, while in truth, it is just as intricate and articulate
as a language of any other race of people. The gwahrai have no written
language. Because of the nature of their language, it cannot be translated
into a written form in any known language, simply beacuse no letters exist
for some of the gwahrai language's sounds, although the same doesn't apply
to the actual meaning of the words.</font>

<p><font color="#FF8080">--- COMBAT ---</font></center>

<p><font color="#FF8080">> Because the gwahrai share their forest home
with predators that constantly hunt them, they have been forced to develop
certain defensive methods. They fight in small groups, and do not like
fighting out in the open. Since they are almost always significantly smaller
than their enemies, they obviously can't win by brute force. Instead, they
use their environment to their advantage, attacking the enemy with blowguns
and slings while remaining hidden.The gwahrai like to attack in this manner
until they have driven off or killed the enemy, or until discovered. If
the latter occurrs, the gwahrai then pounce on the enemy in relatively
large numbers, and attack with thornsticks and foriegn weapons they obtained
through trade. The prefered weapon of the gwahrai is the gwahrai thornstick.
The thornstick is a 40 centimeters long club made of the flexible, yet
amazingly durable, wood from their native trees. At the end of the thornstick
is a razor-sharp thorn, which adds an additional 15 to 25 centimeters to
the club. The gwahrai also use small weapons manufactured by members of
other races. These weapons are most commonly daggers, but also include
short swords (a long sword to a gwahrai), and spike-knuckles. A fighting
gwahrai depends on his/her quickness and agility to win a battle, and shuns
anything that compromises it, such as heavy armor, and heavy or any two-handed
weapon.</font>
<p><font color="#FF8080">> There are no specially trained or professional
soldiers. Rather than having a society that depends on an army or police
force to protect them, everyone, from the lowest to highest members of
society, and of both genders, is trained in the art of combat from an early
age. In the event of a predator attack or an invasion, the civilians can
postpone their daily duties and go into their "combat mode" at the drop
of a hat, in order to come to the defense of their villiage. When fighting
along side elves, the contrasting fighting techniques of the elves and
gwahrai complement each other well, making them a very formidable fighting
force. Fighting gwahrai rely on their great quickness and agility to bring
down enemies, and shun anything that interferes with these qualities. When
forced to fight in close quarters, they try to always be ready to dodge
their enemies attacks, and immediately launch a counter-attack. Since the
gwahrai are used to moving so quickly and fluidly through the trees, swinging
on vines, bouncing off and climbing of the sides of trees, and using both
pairs of hands and their tails to grab and hang from branches and vines,
heavy armor and any two-handed objects would seriously hinder their movements,
thus making them far less formidable in battle.</font>
