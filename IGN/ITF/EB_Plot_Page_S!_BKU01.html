The Zodian Threat</font></font></font>
<br><font color="#33FF33">(Spoiler)</font></center>

<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080">> Zod never completely ran
himself out of magic energy, and therefore, never really died. Instead,
he was forced into a mortal shell which bore the likeness of whatever his
worshippers believed him to look like. When he cast the spell that created
his angels, he saved the last bit of magic energy to keep him alive when
he retreated into his physical body. Since Zod is one of Nnet Olotor's
evil deities, he gains magic energy whenever his worshippers pay homage
to him by committing acts of evil, which usually take the form of the sacrifice
of a person. Normally, Zod can only gain magic energy when his followers
commit such acts. However, when he was trapped in his physical body, he
could gain magic energy from any violent death on Nnet Olotor, regardless
of who was responsible for any such death. Despite this tremendous advantage
to his interests, Zod only used took a bodily form as a last resort for
two important reasons. First, while in his physical body, Zod would no
longer be able to keep a constant eye on his worshippers (an ability that
many other deities have), thus limiting his communicative abilities to
person to person contact. Second and more importantly, as a mortal, Zod
would be subject to every means of death as any mortal creature, and if
he was killed while in his physical body, he would be permanently destroyed
along with his magic order. In order to return to full strength, Zod would
need tens of thousands of violent deaths, and once this is achieved, he
would only need the blood of one of his angels to return to his deity form,
giving him another chance to wreak havoc on Nnet Olotor. Although violent
deaths on Nnet Oloter give Zod strength, they are not necessary for him
to ultimately return to his deity form. Zod could opt to abandon his physical
body before he reaches full strength, but it would mean having to get his
magic energy back solely by rebuilding his religious community, wasting
the violent deaths as part of his plan.</font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080">> Besides his lack of magic
power, Zod also faced a different problem. During the war against Nnet
Olotor's good armies, a great majority of his followers had been killed.
Because Zod, like any other deity, relies on the number and loyalty of
his worshippers not only to maintain the power of his magic order, but
also to stay alive while he's in his deity form, he would need to reestablish
his religious community before his return to his deity form. If Zod does
not have a considerable base of followers by the time of his return to
his deity form, he will gradually lose magic energy after his return, until
the amount of his energy once again matches the energy the number and loyalty
of his worshippers can provide. I'll have to come up with a way for his
followers to start some kind of recruiting campaign to attract new worshippers.
I'm not sure how to do this, but the current situation with the Al Quiada
may give me a few pointers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080">> Because 90 percent of Zod's
army had been wiped out, he obviously would have a hard time converting
new worshippers, let alone having them carry out the tens of thousands
of deaths he needed to return to full strength. However, Zod had anticipated
this setback long before his defeat, and since then had come up with a
countermeasure. Right after his defeat, he had his followers start a false
rumor throughout Nnet Olotor's civilizations that any one of his angels
were inherently evil, and could resurrect the evil deity if they chose
to do so, and only they knew how to do it. It was Zod's hope that this
rumor would trigger a public witch hunting campaign in which enough people
would be killed to satisfy Zod's kill quota. The public is not aware of
the existence of Zod's physical body, the advantages it gives him, or even
the fact that he's still alive. If they were, they would not hunt down
Zod's children, but would rather go after Zod himself. So needless to say,
the existence of Zod's physical body is a secret that Zod only shares with
his most trusted worshippers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080">> However, things didn't go
exactly according to Zod's plan. Most of the elves were appalled at the
idea of killing their own children, even though they 'knew' what the alternative
was. Instead, they searched for ways to purge the evil they were led to
believe was lurking within their children. However, to Zod's good fortune,
one Nnet Olotorian faction was not so compassionate, and felt they needed
to do whatever it took to stop Zod from once again defiling their world.
So they began to hunt down the children of Zod themselves, managing to
slaughter around 300 of their targets, along with the people trying to
defend them. The genocidal faction was eventually stopped, and as punishment
for their actions, was banished from the mainland.</font></font>
<p><font face="Nosfer"><font color="#FF8080">> Although the deity of knowledge
could read the thoughts and secrets of everyone on Nnet Olotor, he could
not read those of other deities. This made it possible for Zod to keep
his secrets safe from the god of knowledge, including whatever plans he
had for his return to power. However, Zod would eventually have to tell
at least a few of his followers about his secret if they were to carry
out his plans, risking discovery. Long before he ever had to worry about
being overthrown, he had his followers build a fortress in an uninhabited
and isolated part of the world, and had them install magic inhibitors throughout
the building. These inhibitors were designed to block out the magic energy
of all deities except Zod, so that only his magic order could exist within
the building. Because the god of knowledge's mind reading ability required
any recipients to be in contact with his own magic energy, he could not
pick up the thoughts of anyone within the boundaries of Zod's fortress,
making it the ideal place for Zodians to hold secret meetings. Needless
to say, Zod never told anyone about his most classified information until
the completion of the fortress. Zod did not worry about the god of knowledge
discovering the truth about his plans for his return to the deity form.
The false rumors Zod was spreading throughout Nnet Olotor in order to incite
its population to hunt down and kill his angels also fooled the deity of
knowledge into believing the rumors. This is because the deity of knowledge's
only information about the mortal world was what he read from people's
thoughts, and the only people who knew the truth were confined within the
walls of Zod's fortress. Also, any campaign to destroy the Orb of Knowledge
would be in vain, because its deity can always create a new one in its
place.</font></font>
