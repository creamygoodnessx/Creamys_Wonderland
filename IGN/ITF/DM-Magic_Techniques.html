orders</a></font></font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font
 color="#ff8080">. These techniques are easy to learn primarily
because unlike spells, they require no specific thought patterns or
spoken
words to perform, and require only the most basic of body motions, but
they still take a certain amount of mental focus to pull off. The main
drawback of magic techniques is that they usually drain magic energy
faster
than spells do, since they involve the direct use of this energy, as
opposed
to converting it into other forms the way spells do. Most of these
techniques
involve the mage projecting and reshaping his/her magic energy in some
way, while others involve moving it from one point to another.</font></font>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">MAGIC BOLT -</font></b>
Quite simply, a projectile made of pure, condensed magic energy,
ejected
at a high rate of speed from the mage's body. Some mages tether a dense
ball of energy by a magic thread attached to one of their fingers , and
then spin it around their hand at a high rate of speed, finally
launching
it at a target by mentally severing the thread, much like using a sling
to launch a stone. Other mages allow energy to build on one of their
shoulders,
allowing the energy to become increasingly dense, and then firing it by
letting it travel along their arm and out of their finger. Magic bolts
can hit with the force ranging from that of a sling stone or of a
cannonball or stronger, depending on
the skill of the mage, and the amount of magic energy invested in the
technique.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">MAGIC ROPE -</font></b>
A long thread of magic energy tethered to the mage's body. This
technique
has a variety of uses, including acting as a climbing rope, a whip, or
a lariat. The strength of the magic rope depends on the amount of magic
energy invested in the technique, and how well the mage can mentally
focus
on keeping the rope intact. Because the rope never leaves the mage's
body,
no magic energy is depleted from the mage unless a portion of the rope
is severed from the mage's body.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">MAGIC SHIELD -</font></b>
A wall of condensed magic energy, projected in front of the mage. The
mage
can invest additional energy into the shield to either make it thicker
to block incoming attacks and hostile spells more effectively, or to
make
it wider to cover a larger area. If a strong enough attack strikes the
shield, it may shatter the shield, and drain the mage of the energy the
mage invested in creating it.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">MAGIC BUBBLE -</font></b>
A protective, airtight bubble of magic energy which completely
surrounds
the mage. Like the magic shield, it protects the mage against incoming
hostile attacks. The bubble protects the mage from every side, but is
usually
thinner and weaker, and thus less effective than the shield. Investing
additional energy into the bubble will make the shield either thicker
and
stronger, or larger, covering a wider area. Mages using this technique
must be careful to not let the bubble run out of air, and dismantle it
before that happens.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">ENCHANT WEAPON -</font></b>
The ability to temporarily enchant a melee weapon with magic energy,
making
it stronger and more effective in combat. Enchanted weapons and shields
can be used to block powerful attacks more effectively, but blocking
attacks
this way is usually less effective than with the magic shield or magic
bubble. An enchanted weapon can also be thrown at enemies while a
thread
of magic energy tethers it to the user, and then pulled back into the
mage's
hand. The enchantment only lasts as long as the weapon is magically
connected
to the mage.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">LIFE TO MAGIC -</font></b>
The ability of a mage to convert his/her own life energy into magic
energy.
The more life energy the mage converts, the more exhausted he/she will
likely feel afterwards. The mage must be careful not to drain his/her
life energy too far, or he/she will be too tired to fight, and in some
rare cases, may even die of exhaustion. This technique is usually used
only as a last resort if the mage needs the additional energy in a life
or death situation.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">DONATE MAGIC -</font></b>
The ability of a mage to donate a portion of his/her magic energy to
another,
friendly mage. This technique will not work unless both mages belong to
the same magic order.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font size="+1">MAGIC LINK -</font></b>
The ability of several mages to temporarily share their magic energy
between
their bodies. The mages stand close together while a thread of magic
energy
connects each of the mages together, like mountain climbers connected
by
a rope. This technique is used primarily when several mages cast a
powerful
spell that takes up more energy that a single mage can hold in his/her
body at once, or when a spell or another technique needs to be
exceptionally
powerful. Magic Link will only work if all of the mages performing it
belong
to the same magic order.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
