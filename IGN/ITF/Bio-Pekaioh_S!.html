<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">> During his adventures with Jonny-V's
party, Pekaioh notices that his companions are extremely powerful fighters.
Travelling with a creation of Zod makes him feel very uncomfortable, and
he starts to become jealous of Oinkillune when he sees that his fighting
prowess is greater than his own. No matter how much Pekaioh trains or what
new techniques he learns, he always seems to be one step behind Oinkillune,
and as the series continues, his jealousy towards Oinkillune grows. After
Oinkillune defeats a seemingly invincible enemy, Pekaioh sees that the
Zodian angel's fighting potential far exceeds anything that he can hope
to accomplish, and this turns out to be a major turning point for the reincarnated
hero. He secretly and desparately seeks out ways to surpass Oinkillune,
and is willing to do so at any cost. Pekiaoh eventually sells his soul
to Zod, the very being his predecessor fought so hard to destroy, and turns
his back on everyone that cared about him, and everyone who looked up to
him. His burning jealously and anger towards Oinkillune, combined with
Zod's corrosive influence, robs him of whatever conscience he has left.
However, Pekiaoh's trecherous act grants him more power than he could have
ever wanted, and allows him to finally surpass Oinkillune, although Oinkillune
or Jonny-V will most likely kill him by the end of the series. I may have
Pekaioh become one of Zod's most prized champions, and a top ranking officer
in his army. Because Pekiaoh violated every rule in his magic order by
joining Zod, he was most likely stripped of his inborn magic abilities
by his creator, but then granted a substantial amount of Zodian magic energy
by his new master. Although Pekaioh became completely evil, his work ethic
remained solid, and through his hard work and patience, it didn't take
him long to master a few Zodian spells.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>

<font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">> Zod may have sought after Pekaioh after
learning about his jealousy towards Oinkillune, and immediately made plans
to include him in a special place within his ranks. But Pekaioh may not
have been Zod's first choice to take this special place. Zod may have had
his eye on Jonny-V since she first became a mage. He figured that Jonny-V
would be perfect for his army, because of her fighting potential and her
apparent willingness to single handedly bring down her father's empire
at all costs. However, Jonny-V refused to serve Zod, since it would mean
giving up the freedom she risked her life to gain from her father, and
she felt that doing so was too high a price to pay for some extra power.
She also may have felt that she could only satisfy her thirst for vengeance
by defeating the Stevens Empire on her own, and receiving any outside help
would cheapen the experience. This forced Zod to find another lackey, but
he wouldn't be able to find one until years later when he discovered Pekaioh.</font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"></font>
