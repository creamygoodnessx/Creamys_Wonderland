<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; As the first
highly
intelligent beings on Nnet Olotor were evolving to their state of
sentience,
a strange energy field was introduced to the world around 20,000 years
ago. Noone knows what this field was originally made of, who or what
created
it, or where it came from, but its impact upon the world is undeniable.
As the first people of Nnet Olotor became self aware, and began to ask
the fundamental questions about life, (who they were, where they came
from,
questions about nature, questions about the cosmos, etc.,) religion
inevitably
followed. The energy field was influenced by the religious beliefs of
all
of Nnet Olotor's societies, and as these beliefs became stronger and
more
widespread, they began to shape the energy field into physical
manifestations
of the world's deities. Now, the deities that the people worshipped and
feared were no longer fictional, and they, their powers, and all
aspects
about them became as real as the people had always believed them to be,
making all religions in the world true. Of course, the belief that
anything
natural on Nnet Olotor was created by these divine beings (such as
Creationism
in Christian mythology) was still false; the energy field could alter
present
reality, but it could not change the past.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; With all of
the
different religions of the world, each with their own deity or deities,
the field was stretched so thin that it could no longer allow for the
creation
of new deities. The gods and goddesses themselves became the source of
the field, and <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a> began to flow forth from them, reaching every nook and
cranny
of Nnet Olotor. The energy field now had a new form; instead of being a
shapeless and chaotic mass, it was now the collective magic energy from
all of the world's deities. Each deity controls his/her own distinctive
catagory of magic energy, known as a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a>, and is able to grant magical abilities to any of his/her
believers
who earn the priviliage of having them. Each magic order contains a
different
pre-determined set of magic spells, and the spells granted depends on
the
type of deity who controls that order. For example, a volcano god would
grant fire and earth based spells to his believers, while a forest
goddess
grants life and plant based spells to those who believe in her. Anyone
who earns his/her deity's magic power is known as a <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Mage">mage</a>,
and is responsible for supporting the interests of the deity he/she
worships,
as well as serving his/her religion and its worshippers. Some deities
do
not grant spellcasting abilities to their worshippers, but instead
choose
to help them directly if their religion or way of life is in dire peril.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; There are
several
religions on Nnet Olotor, most of them polytheistic, with each religion
probably consisting of an average of four or five deities, with each
deity
controlling and governing one magic order. The more worshipers a deity
has, and the more they contribute to their deity's religious
requirements,
the more powerful the deity and his/her magic order become. As the
power
of any given magic order increases and decreases, so too will the
effectiveness
of the spells cast by mages of that order. Thus, a mutually beneficial
relationship between the religious community, the mages, and the
deities
is established; the religious community worships the deity giving
him/her
power, the deity in turn passes that power to the mage by adding power
to the mage's spells, and the mage in turn serves and protects the
religious
community.</font></font>
