<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Binky is a
preteen
gwahrai who lives in a treetop village in the middle of a forest close
to Nnet Olotor's equator. She is a high-spirited bundle of energy who
does
not seem to have an "off switch". She is exceptionally curious, even by
gwahrai standards, and has a natural flair for adventure. This
curiosity
often gets her into trouble, because she often sneaks away from the
safety
of the village to explore the wilderness alone, sometimes getting
herself
into life-threatening situations. In such cases, her adopted brother <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Bio-Oinkillune%28fs%29.html"
 target="_top">Oinkillune</a>
has to find her, rescue her if necessary, and then escort her home.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; But sneaking
out
of town isn't the only kind of trouble Binky gets herself into. She is
extremely reckless and does not understand the difference between acts
of courage and foolish risks. She regularly tries to 'prove' her
supposed
bravery by performing dangerous stunts. Sometimes, Binky and her
friends
like to anger dangerous wild animals, and provoke the animals into
attacking
them. (This could be a gwahrai equivalent of 'cow-tipping'.) There may
be instances where Binky's stunts went horribly wrong, and would have
resulted
in her death if Oinkillune hadn't jumped in and saved her. But no
matter
how many times Binky barely escapes death from her foolish stunts, she
doesn't appear to learn from her ways, and keeps getting into trouble
over
and over again.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; After Binky
and
Oinkillune leave the forest for the first time in their lives, Binky
soon
discovers herself feeling lethargic, and not nearly as energetic as she
normally is. She, Oinkillune, and Jonny-V eventually discover that the
food outside the Gwahrai Forest is not ideal for gwahrai consumption,
and
does not contain the nutrients to keep Binky in perfect health. Because
of this, the party has to return to the forest periodically to get a
fresh
supply of Gwahrai leaves and berries to fully maintain Binky's energy.
They may find an acceptable substitute for this food or find a way to
grow
the forest's food outside the forest, but I'll tackle that issue as I
further
develop the story.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Binky, like
most
of Evil Blood's characters, goes through a number of personality
changes
over the course of the story. She begins thinking she can control any
situation
with ease, and feeling like she's invincible. However, I will probably
have her abruptly realise that there are obstacles in the world too
great
for her to handle, and that the good guys don't always win. I may do
this
by putting her up against a far superior enemy, who thrashes Binky and
keeps knocking her down every time she engages him. This could be a
major
wake up call for Binky that causes her to handle situations more
carefully.
There will of course be other events that help to further reshape
Binky,
although I don't what those situations are just yet. I will most likely
put her in a certain situation late in the story that tests her new
personality,
kind of like a final exam if you will. In fact, I can do something that
demonstrates how much each of the characters have evolved, be it in the
same episode or in one for each character.</font></font>
