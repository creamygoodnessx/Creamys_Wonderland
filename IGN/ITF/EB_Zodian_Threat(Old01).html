<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&gt; Nearly 100 years ago, the evil
deity
Zod was defeated after centuries of war against the good forces of Nnet
Olotor. However, before the deity was completely destroyed, he somehow
managed to impregnate 10 (or maybe many more) elfin women. According to
legend, it may have been possible to revive Zod from his eternal sleep
in the body of someone who shared his blood. In order to complete this
resurrection, a living descendant of Zod would need to be captured, and
forced to be the center in some kind of resurrection ceremony, where
the
evil deity would be reborn within and take over the descendant's body
as
his own, allowing his terror to begin anew. Anyone wishing to bring
back
Zod in this manner would have only one shot at success, as the ceremony
would have to occur on the 100th anniversary of his death. And there
were,
in fact, many Zodian fanatics who looked forward to the day when they
could
see their god again. However, most people were not thrilled at this
possible
turn of events. The people who were responsible for Zod's demise swore
to prevent the evil deity from rising again, whatever the cost. They
began
to hunt down and kill anyone who was suspected of being a descendant of
Zod. It's one of those things where, over time, good becomes evil and
evil
becomes good. The very people who saved the world from Zod's genocide
were
now committing genocide themselves, and the victims were innocent
people
who's only crime was sharing Zod's blood.</font><font
