I've made a modification to my process of disigning the look of my
characters.
The steps are still in the same order as they were before, but I
changed
my technique on Steps 2 and 3. Before I make the height and details
drawing,
I draw a graph of guidelines for the character on an 8 1/2" x 11" sheet
of printing paper. There are three types of such guidelines. The first
and most important type of guidelines are the head markers, which are
horizontal
lines that measure the height of the character in heads from the top of
the head (,excluding head accessories, such as hair or hats) to the
floor.
They are drawn a little bolder than the other types of lines. In my
drawing
style, characters are almost always drawn to the half head, so that
they're
excatly or almost exactly 3, 3 1/2, or 4 etc., heads tall. The second
type
of lines are the feature markers. These horizontal lines measure the
vertical
position of the character's features that do not rest on the head
markers,
and like the head markers, more than one feature may share a feature
marker.
These markers are more widely used on facial features than anywhere
else
on the body. I expect that two characters sharing the same set of
feature
markers will be a very rare occurrence. The third type of lines are the
center lines, which are five vertical lines evenly spaced on the
page.&nbsp;
The character is drawn on top of the line, so it passes through the
character
straight down the center. Center lines serve two purposes. First, they
keep the character's features that are supposed to be in the center in
the center, so the character stands straight up and doesn't slant to
one
side. Second, the center lines keep the five character drawings of the
turnaround spaced evenly apart, so they don't overlap each other.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; After the graph
is
completed, I'm ready to start the height and details drawing. I place a
sheet of tracing paper over the graph, and tape it on securely. I then
draw the front, side, and back of the character on the first, third,
and
fifth center lines respectively, leaving in all the lines I used to
draw
the character. As I'm drawing, I use a millimeter ruler in order to
make
sure that both sides are drawn evenly. After the character is drawn , I
write in the details of how I draw the character where the in-between
angles
would have been on the second and fourth lines. After signing and
dating
the drawing, I then scan it while it's still taped to the graph,
completing
the height and details step of the process.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; The next step
of designing
the appearance of my character is the turnaround. I start by placing a
second sheet of tracing paper over the one I used to draw the height
and
details drawing, and again, taping it on securely. I then trace over
the
three drawings of the character, but this time omitting the unnecessary
lines, giving the character a more 'finished' look. On the second and
fourth
center lines, I draw the in-between angles of the character, and
erasing
the unnecessary lines to give these too, a finished look. I sign and
date
the turnaround,&nbsp; detatch it from the other two sheets, then tape
it
to a blank sheet of printing paper. Finally, I scan the turnaround.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#cc66cc">&gt; I used to draw
the
height and details drawing on a sheet of printing paper, then draw the
turnarounds separately. I would use the graph and tracing paper
technique
on the turnarounds alone. I feel the new process is better, because
it's
easier to trace the front, side, and back angles from the h&amp;ds,
rather
than re-draw them from scratch. Also, my h&amp;ds are more detailed
with
three angles than they are with just the front, and I'm willing to draw
three angle h&amp;ds because of the convenience of only having to trace
the turnarounds on top of them. I'm already drawing Stardancer's
turnaround,
but I drew her h&amp;d using the old method, so I'll have to retrofit
the
turnaround with the new method. As I use this new design method on
Oinkillune,
I'll work on an illustrated version of the process, and give it its own
section on IWOW.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">7/3/2001 - I've come
up with a five step system for me to follow whenever designing the
appearance
for my characters. This system is my own version of <a
 href="http://www.cooltoons.com/shows/artlessons/main.html"
 target="_top">commonly
followed techniques</a> that professional cartoon animators use in
their
work.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><b>Step 1: Concept
sketch
- </b>Just a sketch of what I want the character to look like. The
final
version of the chracter can be dramatically different from what I
originally
intended him or her to look like. Concept sketches are sometimes based
on one or more characters from other cartoons. For example, I used
Alice
Tompkins from The Critic as the base for Oinkillune. The concept sketch
can depict either the whole body or just the head and shoulders, and
can
be drawn at any angle.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><b>Step 2: Height
and
details - </b>This is a drawing of the character's front view in his
or
her default pose, broken down into simple shapes with a few details.
Important
details about the character are pointed out, such as where certain
parts
of the body are located. This drawing also measures the character in
heads.
In my drawing style, a child is usually 2 and a half heads tall,
adults are 3 and a half to 5 heads tall, while teens are usually
somewhere
in the middle.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><b>Step 3:
Turnaround
- </b>The character is drawn at five angles in the default pose; the
front,
the side, the back, and the two in-between angles. If the going gets
rough
in this sketch, I can model a Sculpey head of the character to make
things
a little easier.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><b>Step 4: Movement
sketch - </b>Several quick sketches of the character in various poses.
It's the final confirmation that the character is drawable from all
angles.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366"><b>Step 5: Character
sheet - </b>The character's official full color sheet, with the
character
in a dynamic pose, and a short list of his or her stats on the side.
There
will also be a short description of the character somewhere on the page.</font></font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#993366">&gt; I came up with
a with
a couple more concept sketches for Stardancer about two weeks ago, but
I just can't seem to get the front and profile drawings to match. I'm
seriously
considering changing the design for Stardancer, particularly the
hairstyle
and shoulders. I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with a final
design
for this young lass, otherwise I'd have a hieght and detail sketch of
her
for you to see. As things stand now, whatever my design of Stardancer
is
by the time I get to the turnarounds will be the one I stick with. If I
have any problems with the turnarounds, I may resort to making a
Sculpey
model of Stardancer's head to make things easier.</font></font>
