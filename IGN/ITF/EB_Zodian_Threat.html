<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; Twenty-eight
years
ago, one of Nnet Olotor's bloodiest and longest lasting wars came to an
end. Over the centuries, worshippers of the evil deity Zod were slowly
growing in number, and were notorious for their brutal and savage ways,
including their need to sacrifice people and animals in order to
appease
their god. Nnet Olotor's good armies never saw the Zodians as a major
threat
to the world, because they believed that they were well prepared for,
and
could easily handle anything the Zodians threw at them, but their
confidences
were soon shattered. When Zod's army was powerful enough, and his
religious
community large enough to make his <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Order">magic
order</a> a formidable enough force, he unleashed a devastating attack
on the good armies of Nnet Olotor, marking the beginning of the Zodian
War, the biggest war in the world's history. I haven't yet established
too many details about the war yet, and at this point, most of it is
still
up in the air. By the time the war was over, the good armies had
suffered
heavy losses, but a great majority (possibly 90 percent of more) of
Zod's
worshippers had been killed, severely crippling him and his magic order.</font></font><font

</p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><font color="#ff8080">&gt; According to
legend,
when defeat for the Zodians became obvious, and while Zod still had
enough
<a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Magic_Energy">magic
energy</a> to do so, he used up the last of it to magically impregnate
many thousands of elven women throughout Nnet Olotor, resulting in the
birth of the Zodian <a
 href="http://iwow.cottages.polycount.com/ITF/Glossary_Page.html#Angel">angels</a>,
while sacrificing himself in the process. The legend states that any
one
of these inherently evil angels could resurrect his/her creator with
the
help of inborn information on how to do so. However, no one really knew
for sure exactly what the process of the resurrection was, or how to
prevent
it. So, the public turned to a magic artifact known as the Orb of
Knowledge
for answers. The Orb was the people's direct link to the deity of
knowledge
who collected information from the thoughts of every sentient being on
Nnet Olotor, including those who did not worship him, and freely
distributed
that information to anyone who touched the Orb. But not even the deity
of knowledge was able to give any definite answers about Zod's
resurrection,
only the theories that people had come up with over the years. The
public
began to grow increasingly desperate for a solution, and the people who
were responsible for Zod's demise swore to prevent the evil deity from
rising again, whatever the cost. They began to hunt down and kill
anyone
who was suspected of being an angel of Zod, as well as anyone who tried
to defend them. It's one of those things where, over time, good becomes
evil and evil becomes good. The very people who saved the world from
Zod's
genocide were now committing genocide themselves, and the victims were
innocent people who's only crime was sharing Zod's blood.</font></font><font
