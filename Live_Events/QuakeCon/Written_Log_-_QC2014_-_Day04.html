around 9:45AM. When I got back to the BYOC room, <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/Final_Hours06.jpg">almost everyone had
already left</a>, and only the last few hardcore attendees remained. I
picked up a black garbage bag from a janitor's cart, and went back to
CES to catch up on my </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><a style="font-family: Press Start K;" href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
log. At 9:30AM, I shut down CES and went back to my room, taking the
garbage bag with me. I stuffed all of my dirty laundry into the bag,
dismantled Gwizdo's workstation, packed all of my non-laundry
belongings into my backpack, and left 514 for the last time.<br>
<br>
&gt; With my backpack on my back and the garbage bag in my hand, I
returned to the BYOC room, but the volunteer checking my bag said that
I couldn't take Gwizdo into the room with me, but she offered to hold
onto it until I was ready to leave the room, I took Gwizdo and its
mousepad out of the bag and put it aside. When I got back to CES, I
dismantled the workstation, packed everything into their two boxes, and
left the room to pick up a wheeled dolly, leaving the two boxes behind.
I went to the Business Center to borrow their dolly again, but the </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
people there said that they didn't lend out their dollys, and suggested
that I go to the bell stand instead, so I did. When I got there and
asked to borrow a dolly, David, the person there, said that I would
have to wait ten to fifteen minutes for the dolly, and he would call my
name when it was ready to go. This concerned me, because it was already
after 11AM, and my Super Shuttle bus was scheduled to pick me up at
11:30AM. When the dolly was finally ready about 10 minutes later,
another hotel employee named Robert wheeled the dolly to the BYOC room,
and I led him to my table in row B34. I had forgotten to pack my now
half-full bottle of </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp" target="_top">Coke</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> that I had ordered from </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.dominos.com/" target="_top">Dominos</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> into my boxes, and I couldn't take it on the plane with me because the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_top">TSA</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
Nazis wouldn't allow it, so I gave it away to the attendee sitting in
front of me. After Robert and I put the two boxes onto the dolly, we
headed for the BYOC room's check out line near the exit, but instead of
checking my boxes, the volunteers let me exit the room without opening
them, because the teardown was less than an hour away, and they no
longer had time to check everyone's equipment. I retrieved Gwizdo and
its mousepad from the volunteers who were holding onto it for me, and
then Robert and I headed out.<br>
<br>
&gt; After leaving the BYOC room for the last time, I followed Robert
to the Business Center while he pushed the dolly, and when we got
there, he took the boxes off of the dolly and I tipped him four
dollars. I then handed a shipping label to the FedEx people that my
mother had filled out before the trip, and then waited until they
finished preparing the boxes for shipping. It was then when I noticed
that the clock in the Business Center read exactly 11:30, and I
realized that I would probably miss my ride to the airport. After a few
minutes I put Gwizdo and its mousepad back into my bag, and soon after
that, the FedEx people handed me a receipt and said that I was good to
go. I then went directly to the hotel's front desk where I checked out
of my room, but it was already around 11:45AM, and when I rushed
outside to see if the Super Shuttle bus was there, it was nowhere to be
found. So I went back to the Bell Stand for help, and David said that
the Super Shuttle busses came by the hotel every half hour near the
Atrium's exit, and the next bus was due to arrive in about five
minutes. With no time to waste, I rushed over to the Atrium's exit, but
the noon bus never showed up. At this point I began to panic, because
my plane back to <a href="http://www.phila.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_top">Philadelphia</a> was scheduled to depart at 1:45PM, and
now there was a real possibility that I could miss my flight. However,
the 12:30PM bus actually did show up, and I hopped on board the front
passenger seat. Soon, I was finally on my way to Dallas Fort Worth, and
when I got there, I tipped the driver five dollars. With only minutes
until the 1:15PM boarding time, I got my boarding pass at the kiosk,
went through security without incident, and went to gate A33. Luckily,
the plane was about ten minutes late to start boarding, so that ensured
that I would catch my flight and be on my way home.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
