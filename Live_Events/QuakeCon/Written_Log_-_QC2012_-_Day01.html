<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt;
I flew into </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
from </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.phl.org/" target="_top">Philadelphia</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">,
and the plane landed around 8:45AM Dallas time. From there, I boarded a
</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/" target="_top">Super Shuttle</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> bus
at 9:15AM, and arrived at the </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
which was to start hosting the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
of 2012 half an hour later. Once inside the hotel, I went right up to
the front desk and registered my room, which turned out to be </span></font><font style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="SpaceOne" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Room_574.avi" target="_top">Room 574</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> in the </span></font><font style="color: white; font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.outstandingproductions.com/blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Atrium-II-Nebula-night_MG_0361rev5.jpg">Atrium</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">,
and then went to the Business Center to pick up the boxes containing my
computer that I named <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">The Creamy Entertainment System</a>
and its monitor, but the person behind the desk told me that they
weren't going to arrive at the hotel until 10:30AM. My plan then was to
drop off my suitcase in my hotel room, wait in line until 10:30PM, ask
someone to hold my place in line, pickup CES and its monitor, then get
back in line. When I got to my room, I transferred my <a href="http://www.saitek.com/" target="_top">Saitek</a>
illuminated keyboard from my suitcase to my backpack, so I could
register my keyboard without having to take the suitcase in the line
with me. I was about to leave the room to go wait in line when my
mother called and said that the boxes were already there, and were
signed for by someone called Mr. Spears. So I picked up and signed for
both boxes, then went to the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line01.avi" target="_top">back of the BYOC line</a> sometime before 10:30AM.<br>
<br>
&gt; When I first got in line, I was expecting to wait for less than an
hour before getting to the registration desks in the Pre-Function Area
of the Trinity building, signing in, and getting into the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cybersportsnet/quakecon-2012-byoc-live-stream-experience" target="_top">BYOC</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
in the Trinity Exhibit Hall. However, the line turned out to be longer
than any I have ever waited in at any of the previous QuakeCon events
I've attended. During previous events, the line was either confined to
the Pre-Function Area, or extended merely into the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">Rotunda</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">. But this year, the line began in the hallway of the west wing
of the main building (where the piano was), went down to the end of a
short hallway section, made a right into another section of the
hallway, made a left at the end of that section, made a right into the
Coranado Ballroom at the end, went all the way around the room and out of
the same door into the same hallway, followed the winding hallway again
in reverse on the other side, went through the tower's main lobby,
through the long Trinity Art Corridor, made a right into another long
section of the corridor that led to the Rotunda in the Trinity
building, made a left into a the same short hallway where we had to
start waiting during previous QuakeCons, and finally into the
Pre-Function Area where the registration desks were.<br>
<br>
&gt; Just before 11:20AM, after waiting in line for the first hour, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line04.avi" target="_top">reached the Coranado Ballroom</a>
where I ate the second of four halves of a salami and turkey sandwich my
mother had made me that morning. (I had the first half on the plane).
Just before 3:30PM, I was in the Trinity Art Corridor that connected
the main building with the Trinity building, where some volunteers <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line06.avi" target="_top">handed out tiny black stickers</a>
to the attendees in line. The stickers read, "QuakeCon 2012 Equipment
Tag", and had barcodes on them, and were meant to speed up the
registration process once we got to the front of the line. I took two
stickers, cut open both of my boxes, and put a sticker on the bottom of
CES right under the one from the QuakeCon of 2010, and the other
sticker on the top of the monitor. Just after 4PM, after waiting in line
for a record five and a half hours, an older volunteer by the name of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA40wbgWo2E" target="_top">Ubermom</a>
handed out free <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/QuakeCon_Cup.jpg">QuakeCon
2012 cups</a> to the people in line.<br>
<br>
&gt; Around 4:45PM, I started getting word from the other attendees
that all of the First Come First Serve seats had been filled, and there
were at least 200 people ahead of me in line. So I left CES and its
monitor where they were on the floor and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line08.avi" target="_top">scouted ahead</a>
to investigate, and there were indeed at least 200 people. After
getting back to my place in line, I began to see people come back with
their computers in hand, and this supported the idea that the BYOC had
in fact run out of FCFS seats. Around 7PM, one of the head volunteers
by the name of </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/superpumper" target="_top">Super Pumper</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
announced that there were a number First Come First Serve seats still
available, despite earlier concerns saying
otherwise. He said that the volunteers were in the process of counting
the empty seats, and that they were about to do a head count of the
people in the front of the line and work their way back. When the
number of people they counted was equal to the number of available
seats, that would be the cutoff point, and the people in front of that
point would get into the BYOC. The people behind that point would have
to wait until tomorrow at 7PM, because that's when the $30
Select-A-Seat reserved packages would expire and be given to the people
in the FCFS line. <br>
<br>
&gt; Soon after that announcement, the line moved forward by a small
distance, perhaps only ten or fifteen feet. Some time after Super
Pumper's announcement, the Quakeon staff began handing out free pizza
from </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/" target="_top">Pizza Hut</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
to anyone in the line who would take some, and I took a plain slice for
myself. The staff also handed out free cups of water, so I took one of
those as well. A short time after that, an attendee who had seen the
front of the line said, "This line is not fucking moving", and then
said that somebody who was in the front of the line and had only six
people ahead of him was turned away by the Quakecon staff because there
were no more seats left. <br>
<br>
&gt; Convinced that I was going to be in my spot on the floor where I
was standing for quite a while longer, I took CES and its monitor out
of their boxes, set them up on the floor, and plugged them into the
same outlet where I was charging my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_X" target="_top">Droid</a>
before Super Pumper's
announcement, but which was now behind me in the line. After hitting
the power buttons for both CES and the monitor, the monitor wouldn't
turn on, but I quickly solved that by pushing in the power plug which
had come loose on the monitor's end. Still, nothing showed up on the
monitor, and then I immediately looked inside CES through the top hatch
windows and saw that the CPU fan wasn't spinning. As soon as I moved
the stray wire that was blocking the fan, it started spinning again,
but the boot process never completed. In fact, there was no sign of
life from either the mouse or the USB hub, and the keyboard couldn't
illuminate. Even after turning the system off and on again, then
plugging out the power adapter and plugging it back in, the only things
that turned on were the CPU fan, power LED, the four Y-cable LEDs, the
four back fan LEDs, and the bottom fan grill LED. I didn't have time to
investigate the problem any further, because at the point I had heard
that the line was about to advance significantly, so I immediately
unplugged CES and its monitor, and frantically packed everything back
into their boxes and the backpack as fast as I could. The line started
to move just as I was putting the last of the components away, and
jumped another short distance which was probably fifteen or twenty feet.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime before 8:30PM, the volunteers addressed the line again,
saying that they could make room for more seats by asking people
already in the BYOC room to make their workstations smaller,
essentially packing the attendees into tighter spaces. The number of
attendees was also limited by power consumption issues, and only a
certain number of devices could be supported. Sometime before 9:30PM,
the line took a HUGE jump forward, and that was enough to take me out
of the Trinity Art Corridor and into the Pre-Function Area of the
Trinity building. Just after 10:30PM, a volunteer by the name of Bob
approached me and told me that the QuakeCon staff had found a possible
way to get us into the BYOC room. They offered the attendees who had
been waiting line for the past 12 hours a choice; A: to stay in line
and tough it out, or B: to get a voucher that would allow us to come
back tomorrow after 6PM, and cut to the front of the line and get
priority seating after the $30 Select-A-Seat reserved packages become
available after 7PM. I chose to get the voucher,
and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Voucher.jpg">when I did</a>, I also
got a free <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/QuakeCon_T-Shirt.jpg">QuakeCon
T-shirt</a>. At this point, the line <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line09.avi" target="_top">wasn't moving at
all</a>, and it seemed like the only way for it to advance now was for
attendees already in the BYOC to leave with their equipment to make
room for the people in line.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime after 11:30PM, I made an attempt to get CES to boot up
properly. I took CES out of its box put it on a nearby table without
the monitor, plugged in its power adapter and turned it on. Just like
before, the machine's CPU heat sink fan, the power LED, and the LEDs of
the Y-cables, back fan, and the bottom grill all turned on, but nothing
else. I then unplugged the power adapter, and was about to reseat the
RAM modules, and that's when I saw that the smaller one in the back was
crooked and not parallel to the bigger one. So I lined up the smaller
one to its socket, and pushed down on both sides to snap it in place.
When I started the system then, the result was the same as before.
Then, I plugged out CES, reaseated the big RAM stick, plugged CES back in, and
turned on CES again. This time, the CD drive light blinked a few times
about a second after the other LEDs turned on, and the HDD LED blinked
a short time after that. This confirmed that CES was now working
properly, and that this year's Quakecon trip had been saved. Just
before midnight I brought CES and its monitor back to my hotel room,
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/CES_Temp_Setup.jpg">set
up CES on the desk</a>, charged my Droid, ate the third half of my
mother's sandwich with some <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html" target="_top">Coke</a>,
and spent the rest of the day
starting the digital version of my QuakeCon log.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
