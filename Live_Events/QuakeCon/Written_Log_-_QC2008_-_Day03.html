2008
- Day Three</font></p>
<font style="color: white; font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2">&gt; After
another good night's sleep, I went back to&nbsp;<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a>
in the BYOC room after 8:30AM. The judges for the case mod contest were
scheduled to take a look at the machines between 10AM and noon, so I
tried my best to be sitting at CES at that time, but I did end up
facing a potential distraction. After 11:30AM, more free stuff was
being given away at the Trinity Stage. T-shirts were being tossed into
an eager crowd, but other things that you wouldn't toss towards people
were simply being handed to whoever was at the front of the crowd, such
as cans of&nbsp;<a target="_top" href="http://www.bawls.com/">Bawls</a>,
and copies of games. I failed yet again to catch a shirt, but this time
I came close. I would also spend this time playing some more&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/ghaerosmith/" target="_top">Guitar
Hero: Aerosmith</a>,
but I would always make sure to check CES periodically to see if the
judges were there yet. Just before 1PM, the judges for the case mod
contest finally came by to evaluate CES. I basically told them that I
built CES to look like a game console, which is why I made it small,
and with <a href="http://themushroomkingdom.net/games/smb" target="_top">Super Mario Bros</a>.
graphics. As soon as they left, some news media people showed up and
asked about CES, and I told them basically the same thing I told the
judges.<br>
<br>
&gt; At this point of my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
visit, I had been using
my&nbsp;</font><font style="color: white; font-family: Press Start K;" face="SpaceOne" size="-2"><a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">Sony Cybershot digital camera</a></font><font style="color: white; font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2">
a lot, and was afraid that
my second pair of AA batteries could run down before end of my
vacation. So I went down to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a>'s main building and
bought a
fresh new pair of <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Duracell_AAs.jpg">AA
Duracells</a>
from a corner shop in the atrium. I was already out of pizza, (I had to
throw out the last slice because it got too stale,) so I ordered a
small pepperoni pizza with Cinnasticks around 2:30PM, and my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Saturday%27s_Meal.jpg">order</a>
arrived at the hotel less than an hour later. For the next few hours, I
would make even more attempts to catch a shirt from the Trinity Stage,
but kept failing. One shirt came towards me, but I missed it by inches
when I reached for it. It landed right in front of a guy who was
sitting on the floor behind me, but he snagged it before I could pick
it up. However, just after 6PM that night, my luck changed. I finally
caught a shirt, but two other people happened to catch it too at the
same time. Luckily, they were nice enought to let me have it, so I
finally ended up with an official QuakeCon 2008 T-shirt.<br>
<br>
&gt;
Soon after catching the shirt, I was passing by the Trinity Stage to
check out some of the vendor booths when I saw that free cases of Bawls
were being given away on a cart near the stage. I hurried over, and
happened to grab one of the last ones on the bottom shelf. This put me
in an awkward position, since I now had a case of 24 cans of Bawls, and
no way to drink them all before the end of the vacation, and no way to
carry them all back to New Jersey. My only option was to take back all
the cans I could carry in <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Box.jpg">CES's
box</a>,
my luggage, and my backpack, and give the rest away. After giving a can
to the person sitting to the left of CES, and putting one in my
backpack, I carried the rest of the case up to&nbsp;<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Room_4171.jpg">my
room</a>, where
I put two cans in my suitcase. <br>
<br>
&gt;
Later on in the night, I found a way I might be able to get rid of the
extra Bawls. I decided to give a can to each member of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a>
as a way to thank them for
making available a&nbsp;<a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake
2</a>
server I could play on. I went over to the TastySpleen table asked one
of the members (Fanny) if&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/btfdeathstalker/" target="_top">DeathStalker</a> was still around, and he
said that
he was watching some tournament finals, but would be back for another
round of Quake once the tournament was over. So I went to my room and
retrieved six cans of Bawls, and brought them back to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Setup02%28Light%29.jpg">my
table</a>
to hopefully give to the TastySpleen guys once everyone was there. I
ended the day by continuing to play on CES through midnight.</font><br>
