- Day Four</font></p>

<font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">&gt;
Just after midnight, the staff member at the console game section of
the BYOC approached me where I was sitting at the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Console_Tournament.jpg">console
gaming section</a> and told me that my turn to play in the&nbsp;</span></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike"><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font></a><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike">Street
Fighter 3</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_III:_3rd_Strike">:
Third Strike</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> tournament had
come. I ended up playing two games against a much better player, and we
both picked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_%28Street_Fighter%29" target="_top">Ken</a>
for both matches. Not surprisingly, I lost straight rounds in both
matches, although I didn't get my ass kicked as badly as I thought, as
I never lost a round perfect, and ended up draining my opponent's
health halfway in one round. Satisfied with my chance to participate in
the tournament, I returned to my table.<br>
<br>
&gt; I left the BYOC room to return to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2010/Room_4160.avi">4160</a>
to get some sleep at 4AM. After getting out of bed at 9:45AM, I took
all of my belongings out of room, knowing that I would never be
returning. I brought the empty boxes back down to the BYOC room, and
used them to pack up&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> and all of its
components. The unopened box for the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2010/Elite_Keyboard.jpg">Cyborg
Keyboard</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
was too large to fit in CES's outer box, so I decided to ship it home
separately. Once everything was packed up and in either in a box or my
backpack, I went to the bell stand for a dolly, and a bellhop by the
name of Tadesse followed me to the BYOC room where I had packed of CES,
pushing the dolly in front of him. I put CES's box, the monitor box,
the Elite Keyboard box, and my backpack onto dolly, had my equipment
checked out of the room, and then the two of us went to the Business
Center where I took everything off the dolly and tipped Tadesse five
dollars. I then resealed CES's inner and outer boxes and the monitor
box with tape, and left CES's box and the Elite Keyboard in the
Business Center, taking only my backpack and monitor box. Just after
noon, I checked out of the&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/printable_home.jhtml?ctyhocn=DFWANHH&amp;moreDesc=true" target="_top">Hilton Anatole</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">,
then called up&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://fedex.com/" target="_top">FedEx</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> to
schedule a pickup for the two boxes I left in the Business Center. <br>
<br>
&gt;
Just before 1PM, I took a look at the printout of my airline schedule,
and saw that the plane I was supposed to take home was scheduled to
take off at 12:55PM, meaning that I would never get to&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_top">Dallas Fort Worth</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
on time. So I called home to explain the situation to my mother, and
she rebooked my flight for 4PM, but she later called back and said that
the airline had made a mistake, and the flight was atually taking off
at 5:50PM. With my return flight sorted out, I took the 1:30&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/" target="_top">Super Shuttle</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
bus to the airport and got the around 2PM. As luck would have it, the
flight was delayed due to nearby lightning strikes, so just like the
trip to Dallas, I once again had wait in the plane for over an hour
before taking off.<br>
<br>
&gt; My fifth trip to the&nbsp;</span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
had its ups and downs, just like all of my previous trips to the event,
and was well worth the thousand dollars I paid for the plane ticket,
hotel room, and other expenses. Although I had my share of problems,
mainly the tournament related mishaps, and the QuakeCon's shitty on and
off Internet connection, I had plenty of good things happen that more
than made up for them. I got a high end keyboard at a significant
discount, drew two sprites for my&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Games/MUGEN/Characters_-_Brandy_Oteigh.html">Brandy

character, met the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
people in person, and had about a dozen people stop by and admire CES's
beauty. CES falling off of its dolly on the first day of the event gave
me quite a scare, and although I knew that the machine still had its
audio capabilities, I was not so sure about the video, because the
colors were acting weird throughout the event. But after I got home and
plugged CES into a different monitor, I saw that the colors were just
fine, indicating that the monitor was faulty and that CES had not been
damaged when it was dropped. Finally, as the result of the help I got
from TastySpleen, I got <a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a> to run normally on CES less than a week after the event. Thanks for
reading, and I hope to be able to go back to the QuakeCon in 2012.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
