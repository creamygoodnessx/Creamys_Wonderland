<font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2">&gt; I woke up
after six the next
morning, and went down to the Business Center to pick up my monitor
around 7:30AM, but the door was locked and there was a sign that
basically said &#8220;be back shortly&#8221;. But after a short wait, someone from
the inside let me in, and I picked up my monitor and brought it to the
BYOC room and finished <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Setup01%28Dark%29.jpg">setting
it up</a> around 8AM. About half an hour later, the beeping sound
I heard when I initially set up&nbsp;<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a>
was now happening at a much more frantic pace. After inspecting a few
wires, I realized that the beeping was coming from the UPS, and that I
had <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/UPS_Plug_Error.jpg">plugged
the UPS into itself</a>,
and CES into the power strip. The monitor had been draining the UPS's
power since I plugged it in, and the UPS was not receiving any new
power from an outlet, causing its power to drain. So I shut down CES
and switched the errant plugs, and this solved the problem.<br>
<br>
&gt;
With the errant power plug problem out of the way, I still wasn't able
to connect to the Internet. I knew that the most likely reason was that
I was using the static IP address that I assigned to CES for my home
network, and the BYOC used DHCP. However, I didn't know the correct
syntax for the ifconfig command to switch to a dynamic IP address, so I
went to the nearby help desk for help. Luckily, the guy behind the
counter was more knowledgeable about <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_top">Linux</a>
than I was, and fixed the problem by editing a file called
/etc/network/interfaces using a command line text editing program
called <a href="http://lowfatlinux.com/linux-editor-pico.html" target="_top">Pico</a>.
He commented out the IP settings and set up CES to use a dynamic IP
address with the line &#8220;iface eth0 inet dhcp&#8221;. The next time I ran <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" target="_top">Firefox</a>,
I was able to successfully connect to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a>.<br>
<br>
&gt; Just before 9:30AM, someone recognized me from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a>
two years earlier. It turned
out to be <a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/jehar/" target="_top">Jehar</a> from the <a href="http://www.tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">TastySpleen</a>
community, and he said that his group was sitting in Row B22 in case I
wanted to stop by later. I went back to my table, and called my mother
to continue the conversation that we started yesterday when I was on
the Shuttle Bus. We spent 10 minutes talking about the rest of my
experiences at the <a href="http://www.phl.org/" target="_top">airport</a>, and the price of the drinks
in <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Room_4171.jpg">my
hotel room</a>'s mini-bar. After hanging up, I went back to my
room and brought the six remaining slices of pizza, the 2-liter bottle
of <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp" target="_top">Coke</a>,
and my purple drink bottle down to CES. Around 10:30AM, I went to the
room next to the BYOC room, and watched a few rounds of a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/GH_Tourney.jpg">Guitar
Hero tournament</a>, where two players would compete against each
other in a game of <a href="http://www.guitarherogame.com/gh3/" target="_top">GH3</a> on the Trinity Stage. While in
the same room, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Creamy&amp;Wolfenstein_Chick.jpg">got
my picture taken</a> with a lady from the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Wolfenstein_Booth.jpg">Wolfenstein
booth</a>, then played <a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/ghaerosmith/" target="_top">Guitar
Hero: Aerosmith</a> at another booth, starting off with Walk This
Way (<a href="http://www.rundmcmusic.com/" target="_top">Run
DMC</a> version) on Easy. I also went to the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Bawls_Booth.jpg">Bawls
booth</a> and bought a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/Bawls.jpg">can
of Bawls</a>, which would normally cost over two dollars a can,
for only a dollar. <br>
<br>
&gt;
Around 12:45PM, some members of the QuakeCon staff brought a box of
QuakeCon 2008 T-shirts on the Trinity Stage, and crowd of about a
hundred people gathered in front of the stage. The people on the stage <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2008/T-Shirt_Toss01.avi">tossed
the shirts</a>
one at a time into the crowd in random places, and the people in the
crowd reached for and tried to grab whatever shirts flew in their
direction. I tried to catch some shirts that came towards me, but I
didn't have any luck. The QuakeCon staff would give away more shirts a
few more times throughout the day, but during the times I was there, I
either wasn't able to catch any shirts, or took an opportunity to
capture the tossings on video.<br>
<br>
&gt; Just before 1PM, I met the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/TastySpleen.jpg">TastySpleen
people</a> at their table. I asked them how I could connect to
their server, and they suggested that I use&nbsp;<a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake
2</a>'s
built-in browser to search for a server called BlackBox. I told them I
did just that, but the game quit after about a second of each
connection attempt. When I said that I was connecting as Agent_Mothman,
they said they saw me connect, but couldn't understand why I kept
leaving so quickly. The TastySpleen guys said that Blackbox was going
to be down for the next hour or so, so I took this time to try to fix
whatever error that was preventing me from connecting. I ran Quake 2
from the command line, tried to connect to BlackBox, but got
disconnected again with an error that read: "Couldn't write
config.cfg". I thought that this might be a permissions related
problem, but I found that this wasn't the case after I saw that I owned
the permissions to everything in my Quake2 folder. Completely stumped,
I decided to give up on Quake 2 for the time being. Not long after
that, the person sitting at the machine immediately to my right asked
me to make room on my table for his friend who would be arriving
sometime later in the event. So I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Setup02%28Dark%29.jpg">put
CES behind my mousepad</a>, and this created about a foot and a
half of empty space on the right side of my table.<br>
<br>
&gt;
Just before 2PM, I went back to the TastySpleen tables, where team
member <a href="http://www.xfire.com/profile/btfdeathstalker/" target="_top">[BTF]DeathStalker</a> was setting up a
server called BTF with infinite
ammo. I went back to CES and tried to connect to it, and amazingly, I
was able to do so without errors. After I switched to an old fashioned <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx" target="_top">Microsoft</a>
ball mouse, the two of us duked it out in a modified version of The
Edge for several minutes, and he ended up beating me 15 to 6. The
server went back up around 5:30PM, so I joined the server, and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QuakeCon2008_-_Q2_001.dm2">once
again played on The Edge</a>.
At first I was playing against Deathstalker, and he basically raped my
ass six ways to Thursday, scoring nearly 20 frags to my -1 before more
people joined in 11 minutes into the match. I started to get some frags
in, and ended up in last place with 28 frags when [BTF]Deathstalker
reached the 80 frag limit. <br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime around 6PM, I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Recorded_Games/QuakeCon2008_-_Q2_002.dm2">played
another round</a>,
this time in Tokay's Towers against several players.&nbsp;About
fifteen
minutes after the round began, an announcement came over the
loudspeaker about a case mod contest at the Information Desk. I didn't
want to take a chance in missing it, so I cut my Quake 2 game short
after scoring 20 frags and went over to the Info Desk to enter. After
writing on a list my name, CES's name and row (B14), I was given a red
flag with &#8220;M3&#8221;written on it, and asked to stick it onto my machine. The
man behind the desk said that judges would evaluate the machines the
next day between 10AM and noon, so I made it a point to try to remember
to be at CES at that time. I returned to CES and <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_-_Flag.jpg">stuck
the flag on the inside edge</a> of the Mario 4&#8221; angle iron.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime after 11PM, I wanted to transfer the pics and movies
from my&nbsp;</font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" face="SpaceOne" size="-2"><a href="http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/sony-cybershot-dscp92-reviews.html" target="_top">Sony Cybershot digital camera</a></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;" size="-2">
to CES, but I couldn't find
the camera's USB cord in either my backpack or <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2008/CES_Box.jpg">CES's
box</a>.
Thinking that I must have packed the cord in my suitcase, I went up to
my hotel room to search for it there, but still couldn't find it. But
instead of going back to the BYOC room to check CES's box again, I
decided that it would be a good time to go to bed. Besides everything I
mentioned above, I also played <a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" target="_top">Stepmania</a> on CES, played more Guitar
Hero: Aerosmith, bought a second can of <a href="http://www.bawls.com/" target="_top">Bawls</a>,
and watched some YouTube videos throughout the day.</font><br>
