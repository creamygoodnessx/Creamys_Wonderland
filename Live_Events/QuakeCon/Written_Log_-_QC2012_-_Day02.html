I went to bed the next day around 2:45AM, got out of bed around 10AM
and took a shower. For the next few hours, I played some <a href="http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SuperTuxKart</a> on <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a>, and caught up on my <a href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a> log. Around 5:45PM, I dismantled <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/CES_Temp_Setup.jpg">CES's setup</a>,
packed CES and its monitor into their boxes, packed the rest of the
components into the appropriate boxes or my backpack, and painstakingly
carried everything back to the Pre-Function Area of the Trinity
building. Some of the attendees had <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Line_Camping.jpg">set up their computers</a>
near to the wall outlets in the room, and I thought about whether or
not I should do the same. I ended up deciding against it, since I
didn't know what was going to happen next. So I went up to the
registration desks and told the volunteers there that I had a <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Voucher.jpg">voucher</a> for the </span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cybersportsnet/quakecon-2012-byoc-live-stream-experience" target="_top">BYOC</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">,
and asked what line I should get into. The volunteers said that they
would let everyone know what to do soon, so I got into the same place
in line where I was last night.<br>
<br>
&gt; Around 6:30PM, the line for the attendees with the vouchers was started on the left side of the room, and I <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line10.avi" target="_top">joined it</a>
as fast as I could. Throughout the previous day, I kept hearing people
say that the BYOC $30 Select-A-Seat reservations would expire at 7PM on
the current night, and become open to the First Come First Serve
attendees. However, that didn't happen when 7PM actually came, and the
announcement of the seats becoming available didn't come until twenty
minutes later. Even then, there was no sign of anyone in any of the
lines getting into the BYOC until 8PM when another announcement was
made; the BYOC attendees who were <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Movies/QuakeCon_2012/Registration_Line09.avi" target="_top">camping out</a>
all night the previous night and throughout the current day would get
priority, followed by those with vouchers, and then everybody else.
Soon afterwards, we were given name badges that we had to write our
handles on, and one page waivers we had to fill out. The people in the
voucher line didn't even have to go to a table to get registered,
because the volunteers had portable scanners and were scanning the
barcodes of our name badges, registration confirmation sheets, and the
equipment tags on our computers and monitors. When we got into the BYOC
room, we had to go to a table to have our bags and boxes checked for
contraband, and then to another table to be assigned seats. Just before
8:30PM, I reached my <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/BYOC_-_Empty_Table.jpg">workspace</a>, which was very small, but just big enough to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/CES_Setup.jpg">accommodate CES</a> and all of its components.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sometime after 9PM, an announcement came from the Information Desk saying that the </span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><span style="color: white;"></span></font><font style="font-family: Press Start K;" size="-2"><a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/" target="_top">Pizza Hut</a></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;">
truck outside was about to leave, and was selling large pies for
only $5, so I hurried over to the truck, and so did about fifty other
people. Some of them cut through the BYOC line and one of the
volunteers yelled at them, asking them to go around the line. The line
to the pizza truck was long but moved quickly, and when I got to the
front, I tried to order a medium pepperoni pie, but they were out of
them, so I settled for a small personal pie for two bucks and a 20
ounce bottle of <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/" target="_top">Pepsi</a> for another two bucks as <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Friday%27s_Meal.jpg">my meal for Friday</a>. The rest of the night was relatively uneventful, as I basically spent it playing SuperTuxKart, playing <a href="http://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/tetris_2.html" target="_top">Tetris 2</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Punch-Out%21%21" target="_top">Super Punch Out</a> on the <a href="http://www.zsnes.com/" target="_top">ZSNES</a> emulator, and watching <a href="http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/phineasandferb/" target="_top">Phineas and Ferb</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a>.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
