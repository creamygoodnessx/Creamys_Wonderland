After finishing my pizza, I flossed and brushed my teeth, and then went
to bed sometime after 12:30AM. I got out of bed after 8PM, showered,
put the clothes I wore on Friday back on, and then returned to the BYOC
room where I played a little more <a href="http://stronghold.drdteam.org/" target="_top">Stronghold</a>.
After a while, the cold of the BYOC room was getting very uncomfortable
for me, so just before 10:30AM, I went back to the vendor's room to see
if there were any clothes I could buy that would warm me up. At the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlitchGear" target="_top">Glitchgear</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/GlitchGear_Booth.jpg">booth</a>, there was an assortment of clothes, so I asked one of
the vendors if he had a hoodie, and said that he did, and he showed me
some of the hoodies he had in stock. There were a few <a href="http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-US/home/index.aspx" target="_top">Assassin's Creed</a>
hoodies, but there was also one with the <a href="http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Aperture_Science_Enrichment_Center" target="_top">Aperture Laboratories</a> logo
from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_%28series%29" target="_top">Half-Life</a> series. The hoodie was a small size, but I normally
wear large size shirts, so I tried it on to see if it would fit. The
fit was OK, so I gave the vendor $40 and walked back to&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Builds/CES/Builds_-_CES%28fs%29.html" target="_top">CES</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> with my new
<a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/Aperture_Labs_Hoodie.jpg">Aperture Laboratories hoodie</a>. I then pulled my <a href="http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Doom" target="_top">Doom</a><span style="color: black;">_</span><a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2012/Doom_T-Shirt.jpg">T-shirt</a> and a pair
of jeans from CES's two boxes, and brought them up to my hotel room so
I could change into them in privacy. With my new clothes on, I returned
to Trinity Hall, where I asked people at the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/BYOC_Reg_Booth.jpg">BYOC registration booth</a> if
I could get the free&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><font style="color: white;" size="-2"><a style="font-family: Press Start K;" href="http://www.quakecon.org/" target="_top">QuakeCon</a></font></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> 2014 T-shirt that was included in my $50
Select-A-Seat package. The volunteer at the booth directed me to a
booth in the vendor's room where I could pick it up, so I went to <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/Pre-Reg_Booth.jpg">that
booth</a>, and when I did, the guy there scanned my con badge and gave me a
large <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/QuakeCon_2014_T-Shirt.jpg">QuakeCon 2014 T-shirt</a>.<br><br>&gt; Sometime around 1:15PM, the
guy sitting to my right told me that the people at the <a href="http://www.alienware.com/" target="_top">Alienware</a>
vendor's booth in the BYOC room were giving away free T-shirts, so I
went to the booth and picked up an extra large <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/Lo_Jack_T-Shirt.jpg">T-shirt</a>. Just after 5PM,
the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://www.modders-inc.com/" target="_top">Modders-Inc</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><span style="color: black;"></span></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> judges came by my table in order to examine CES. One
of the judges remembered my machine from when I entered in 2012. I
showed the judges two new features I added to CES since the last
tournament, which were a new pair of RAM mods, and a cold cathode
grill, both of which were controlled with a set of three new switches
on the front of the machine. When the judges left to go to the next
contestant, they told me that they would talk to all of the contestants
by 6PM and tell them who was moving on to the finals and who wasn't.
After the judges left, I called up my nephew Austin and asked him if he
wanted to join me in a&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://planetquake.gamespy.com/quake2/" target="_top">Quake 2</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> deathmatch on the&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://tastyspleen.net/" target="_top">Tastyspleen</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> servers.
He agreed to my invitation, and he used the copy of Quake 2 I copied to
his flash drive several months earlier to join me on Tastyspleen's
Vanilla server. After a few games, Austin took a break so he could
install Quake 2 on a hard drive of one of his computers, and this
allowed me, Austin, and Austin's brother Brandon to all play on a DM
server. But after a few games, Austin said that he had to take another
break to have dinner, and asked me to call him back in about an hour.<br><br>&gt;
I stayed at my table non-stop from the time the Modders-Inc judges
left until well after 7PM, and the judges never returned as promised,
so I assumed that I once again failed to make it to the finals and gave
up on the case mod contest altogether. Just after 7:40PM, I called back
Austin, and the two of us played on the DM server again until 10:15PM,
and the two of us stayed on the phone the entire time. In fact, my
headphones weren't even plugged into CES during the gaming session, but
instead were plugged into my&nbsp;</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy" target="_top">Samsung Galaxy smartphone</a></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"> so I could talk
to Austin. Although I couldn't hear CES's audio output, I could hear
the game on the phone through Austin's speakers in the background. By
the time our two hour plus gaming session was over, my left ear was
hurting because I was wearing the headphones for so long, and now I was
forced to take them off and massage my ear. I left the BYOC room before
11:30PM and went back to the outdoor food court, and bought a 20 ounce
Coke and a pepperoni pizza from the <a href="http://creamyg.jdluke.com/Live_Events/QuakeCon/Pics/QuakeCon_2014/Yummy_Pizza_Truck.jpg">Yummy Pizza truck</a>, then took my
meal up to my hotel room where I spent the rest of the night enjoying
it while watching playbacks of my Tastyspleen Quake 2 deathmatches on
Gwizdo that I played earlier that day with Austin.</span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font><font size="-2"><span style="font-family: Press Start K; color: white;"></span></font>
